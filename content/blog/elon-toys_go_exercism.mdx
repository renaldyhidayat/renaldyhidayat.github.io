# Elon Toys

In the **Elon Toys** problem, we create a remote-controlled car that can drive, display its distance and battery status, and determine if it can finish a given track distance based on its battery capacity. This exercise emphasizes object-oriented programming in Go, particularly with structs and methods.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to create a `Car` type that supports:
1. Driving a specified distance while consuming battery.
2. Displaying the distance driven and the current battery level.
3. Determining if the car can finish a race given its speed and battery drain.

## Approach

The approach involves defining a `Car` struct with methods to handle driving logic, displaying current status, and checking if the car can complete a given distance based on its battery capacity.

### Algorithm

1. **Car Struct**:
   - Define a struct to hold the car's speed, battery drain rate, current battery level, and distance driven.

2. **NewCar Function**:
   - Initialize a new car with specified speed and battery drain, starting with a full battery.

3. **Drive Method**:
   - Implement the logic to increase the distance driven if the battery allows.

4. **DisplayDistance Method**:
   - Return a formatted string showing how far the car has driven.

5. **DisplayBattery Method**:
   - Return a formatted string displaying the current battery percentage.

6. **CanFinish Method**:
   - Calculate whether the car can finish the track based on its speed, battery drain, and distance to be traveled.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package elon

import "fmt"

// Car implements a remote-controlled car.
type Car struct {
	speed        int
	batteryDrain int
	battery      int
	distance     int
}

// NewCar creates a new car with given specifications.
func NewCar(speed, batteryDrain int) *Car {
	return &Car{
		speed:        speed,
		batteryDrain: batteryDrain,
		battery:      100,
	}
}

func (c *Car) Drive() {
	if c.battery >= c.batteryDrain {
		c.distance += c.speed
		c.battery -= c.batteryDrain
	}
}

func (c *Car) DisplayDistance() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("Driven %d meters", c.distance)
}

func (c *Car) DisplayBattery() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("Battery at %d%%", c.battery)
}

func (c *Car) CanFinish(trackDistance int) bool {
	return (c.battery / c.batteryDrain) * c.speed >= trackDistance
}
```


Explanation
    1. **Car Struct**:

        Contains fields for speed, batteryDrain, battery, and distance to manage the state of the car.

    2. **NewCar**:

        Constructs a new car with a full battery and specified speed and drain.
    
    3. **Drive**:

        Increments the distance if there is enough battery to cover the distance specified by the car's batteryDrain.

    4. **DisplayDistance**:

        Returns a string with the total distance driven in meters.

    5. **DisplayBattery**:

        Returns a string indicating the current battery percentage.

    6. **CanFinish**:

        Checks if the car has enough battery to cover a specified trackDistance based on its speed and battery drain.

### Time and Space Complexity

    - #### **Time Complexity**:

        - All methods operate in constant time O(1) as they perform basic arithmetic and string formatting.


    - #### **Space Complexity**:

        - The space complexity is also O(1) as the Car struct only allocates a fixed amount of memory for its fields.

## Conclusion
The Elon Toys problem demonstrates how to effectively model an object-oriented system in Go using structs and methods. It reinforces concepts such as encapsulation and state management while allowing for interaction through well-defined interfaces.
