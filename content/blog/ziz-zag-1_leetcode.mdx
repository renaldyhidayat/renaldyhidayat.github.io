## Problem Statement

The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows. The following is the zigzag representation for the string with 3 rows:

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
```
### Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I
```
Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: s = "A", numRows = 1
Output: "A"
```
## Approach
To convert the string into a zigzag pattern, we will use a list of strings to represent each row of the zigzag. We will iterate through the input string and determine which row the current character belongs to, toggling between moving downwards and upwards in the zigzag.

### Algorithm
1. **Initialize Rows**: Create a slice of strings to hold each row's characters.
2. **Iterate Through the String**: For each character in the string, append it to the appropriate row.
3. **Determine Direction**: Keep track of the current row and the direction (down or up) to determine the next row index.
4. **Construct the Result**: Concatenate all rows to form the final string.

### Implementation in Go
Here is the Go implementation of the solution:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// convert converts the input string to its zigzag representation based on the number of rows
func convert(s string, numRows int) string {
    if numRows == 1 {
        return s
    }
    
    rows := make([]string, numRows)
    currentRow := 0
    direction := 1 // 1 for down, -1 for up
    
    for i := 0; i < len(s); i++ {
        rows[currentRow] += string(s[i])
        
        // Change direction at the top and bottom rows
        if currentRow == 0 {
            direction = 1
        } else if currentRow == numRows-1 {
            direction = -1
        }
        
        currentRow += direction
    }
    
    result := ""
    for i := 0; i < numRows; i++ {
        result += rows[i]
    }
    
    return result
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3)) // Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
    fmt.Println(convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 4)) // Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
    fmt.Println(convert("A", 1))               // Output: "A"
}

```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes a slice of strings called rows to hold the characters for each row. It also tracks the currentRow and direction of movement.
2. **Character Placement**: As we loop through the characters in the string, we append each character to the corresponding row based on the current row index.
3. **Direction Control**: The direction toggles between downward and upward as we reach the first and last rows.
4. **Result Construction**: Finally, we concatenate the strings from all rows to form the output.


### Time and Space Complexity
**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string, since we visit each character exactly once.
**Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the characters in the rows.


## Conclusion
This solution efficiently converts a string to its zigzag representation in a specified number of rows, leveraging simple string manipulations and an understanding of the zigzag pattern. The algorithm operates within linear time complexity, making it suitable for longer strings.
