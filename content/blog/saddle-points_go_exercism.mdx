## Problem Statement

In a matrix, a saddle point is an element that is both the minimum in its column and the maximum in its row. This problem requires identifying all saddle points in a given matrix and returning their positions.

## Approach

To find saddle points in the matrix, we will:
1. Determine the maximum values in each row.
2. Determine the minimum values in each column.
3. Compare the two results to identify saddle points.

### Algorithm

1. Parse the input string to create a matrix of integers.
2. For each row, find the maximum value and its indices.
3. For each column, find the minimum value.
4. If a maximum value from a row is also the minimum value in its respective column, it is a saddle point.
5. Return the positions of all saddle points.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package matrix

import (
	"errors"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
)

type Matrix [][]int
type Pair [2]int

func New(s string) (*Matrix, error) {
	rowList := strings.Split(s, "\n")

	m := make(Matrix, 0, len(rowList))

	for _, rowEntry := range rowList {
		row := strings.Fields(rowEntry)

		r := make([]int, 0, len(row))

		for _, element := range row {
			e, err := strconv.Atoi(element)

			if err != nil {
				return &Matrix{}, errors.New("matrix error")
			}
			r = append(r, e)
		}
		m = append(m, r)
	}

	return &m, nil
}

func (m *Matrix) Saddle() []Pair {
	mat := *m
	output := []Pair{}

	iRows, jCols := len(mat), len(mat[0])

	if iRows == 0 || jCols == 0 {
		return output
	}

	booleanMatrix := make(Matrix, iRows)

	for i := 0; i < iRows; i++ {
		booleanRow := make([]int, jCols)
		booleanMatrix[i] = booleanRow
	}

	for i := 0; i < iRows; i++ {
		row := mat[i]
		maxValue := row[0]

		for j := 1; j < jCols; j++ {
			if row[j] > maxValue {
				maxValue = row[j]
			}
		}

		for j := 0; j < jCols; j++ {
			if row[j] == maxValue {
				booleanMatrix[i][j] = 1
			}
		}
	}

	for j := 0; j < jCols; j++ {
		minValue := mat[0][j]

		for i := 1; i < iRows; i++ {
			if mat[i][j] < minValue {
				minValue = mat[i][j]
			}
		}

		for i := 0; i < iRows; i++ {
			if mat[i][j] > minValue {
				booleanMatrix[i][j] = 0
			}
		}
	}

	for i := 0; i < iRows; i++ {
		for j := 0; j < jCols; j++ {
			if booleanMatrix[i][j] == 1 {
				saddle := Pair{i + 1, j + 1}
				output = append(output, saddle)
			}
		}
	}

	return output
}
```

### Explanation
    - The New function creates a new matrix from the input string, parsing rows and converting elements to integers.
    - The Saddle method processes the matrix to find saddle points by first identifying maximum values in each row and minimum values in each column, using a boolean matrix to track potential saddle points.
    - Finally, it checks for saddle points by comparing the boolean matrix and the original matrix values.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. We go through the matrix several times to compute maximums and minimums.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(n * m) for the boolean matrix used to track potential saddle points.

## Conclusion
The Saddle Points solution efficiently identifies all saddle points in a matrix by leveraging comparisons of row maximums and column minimums. This approach showcases effective use of matrix traversal and condition checking, providing a clear understanding of the concept of saddle points in a matrix.
