# Gopher's Gorgeous Lasagna

In this article, we'll solve the "Gopher's Gorgeous Lasagna" problem using Go. This simple problem requires calculating the total time taken to prepare and cook lasagna based on the number of layers and actual cooking time in the oven. Let's walk through the solution step by step.

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with writing three functions to help Gopher track the time required to make lasagna:

1. **RemainingOvenTime**: Given the actual time the lasagna has been in the oven, return how many minutes it still needs to bake.
2. **PreparationTime**: Calculate the total preparation time based on the number of lasagna layers, where each layer takes 2 minutes to prepare.
3. **ElapsedTime**: Return the total time spent making the lasagna, which includes both the preparation time and the time spent baking.

## Approach

The problem can be broken down into three distinct steps, which makes it easy to solve with simple arithmetic calculations.

1. **Remaining Oven Time**: You need to subtract the actual time the lasagna has spent in the oven from the total oven time required.
2. **Preparation Time**: Multiply the number of layers by the time it takes to prepare each layer (2 minutes).
3. **Elapsed Time**: Sum up the total preparation time and the actual time in the oven.

### Algorithm

- **Remaining Oven Time**:
  ```go
  func RemainingOvenTime(actualMinutesInOven int) int {
      return OvenTime - actualMinutesInOven
  }
  ```
- **Preparation Time**:

  ```go
    func PreparationTime(numberOfLayers int) int {
        return numberOfLayers * 2
    }
  ```

- **Elapsed Time**:

  ```go
  func ElapsedTime(numberOfLayers, actualMinutesInOven int) int {
  return PreparationTime(numberOfLayers) + actualMinutesInOven
  }

  ```

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go implementation of the solution:

```go
package lasagna

// OvenTime is a constant that defines the total baking time required for lasagna
const OvenTime = 40

// RemainingOvenTime returns the remaining minutes based on the actual time already spent in the oven.
func RemainingOvenTime(actualMinutesInOven int) int {
	return OvenTime - actualMinutesInOven
}

// PreparationTime calculates the time needed to prepare the lasagna based on the number of layers.
func PreparationTime(numberOfLayers int) int {
	return numberOfLayers * 2
}

// ElapsedTime calculates the total time to create and bake a lasagna.
func ElapsedTime(numberOfLayers, actualMinutesInOven int) int {
	return PreparationTime(numberOfLayers) + actualMinutesInOven
}
```

### Explanation

- **OvenTime** is defined as a constant (40 minutes) since thatâ€™s the default required time for baking lasagna.
- **RemainingOvenTime** function subtracts the number of minutes the lasagna has been in the oven from the total required time.
- **PreparationTime** multiplies the number of layers by 2 (since each layer takes 2 minutes to prepare).
- **ElapsedTime** calculates the total time by adding both the preparation and baking times.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: Each function operates in constant time, O(1), since the operations involve only basic arithmetic.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also O(1) as the functions only use a few variables and do not require any additional data structures.

## Conclusion
The **Gopher's Gorgeous Lasagna** problem is a simple yet practical exercise in using basic arithmetic operations and constants in Go. By breaking the problem down into smaller parts, we can efficiently calculate the preparation and baking times for a lasagna recipe. Happy coding and baking!
