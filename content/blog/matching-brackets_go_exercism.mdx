## Problem Statement

The Matching Brackets problem involves determining whether the brackets in a given string are properly matched and nested. The input may contain different types of brackets, including parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, and curly braces `{}`. The goal is to ensure that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and that they are correctly ordered.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. As we iterate through the input string, we will:
1. Push each opening bracket onto the stack.
2. For each closing bracket encountered, check if it matches the last opened bracket (the one at the top of the stack).
3. If they match, pop the last opened bracket off the stack. If they do not match, return false immediately.
4. Finally, if the stack is empty after processing the entire string, all brackets are matched correctly; otherwise, return false.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize an empty stack to store opening brackets.
2. Loop through each character in the input string:
   - If the character is an opening bracket, push its matching closing bracket onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket, check if it matches the bracket at the top of the stack:
     - If it matches, pop the top of the stack.
     - If it does not match, return false.
3. After processing all characters, check if the stack is empty:
   - If it is empty, return true (all brackets are matched).
   - If it is not empty, return false (some brackets are unmatched).

### Implementation in Go

```go
package brackets

func Bracket(input string) bool {
	stack := []rune{}

	for _, ch := range input {
		switch ch {
		case '[', '{', '(':
			stack = append(stack, matchingBracket(ch))
		case ']', '}', ')':
			if len(stack) == 0 || stack[len(stack)-1] != ch {
				return false
			}
			stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
		}
	}

	return len(stack) == 0
}

func matchingBracket(ch rune) rune {
	switch ch {
	case '[':
		return ']'
	case '{':
		return '}'
	case '(':
		return ')'
	}
	return 0
}
```

### Explanation
    - The Bracket function takes a string as input and initializes an empty slice stack to hold the expected closing brackets.
    - As we iterate through the input, we check for opening brackets and push their matching closing brackets onto the stack.
    - For closing brackets, we verify if the stack is not empty and if the top of the stack matches the current closing bracket. If they match, we pop the top element from the stack.
    - At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, it indicates all brackets were matched correctly; otherwise, some brackets are unmatched.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. We traverse the string once, performing constant time operations for each character.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case, where all characters are opening brackets, and they are stored in the stack.

## Conclusion
The Matching Brackets problem can be efficiently solved using a stack-based approach. This method allows us to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that all brackets in the input string are correctly matched and nested. The solution is both time-efficient and space-efficient, making it suitable for practical applications in parsing expressions or validating input formats.
