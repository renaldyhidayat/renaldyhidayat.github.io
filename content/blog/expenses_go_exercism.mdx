# Expenses

The **Expenses** problem involves managing and calculating expenses within a period and by category. We need to handle filtering expense records based on specific conditions like date ranges and categories. The solution should also handle cases where there are no expenses for a given category.

## Problem Statement

We are tasked with the following:
1. Filter expenses by a specific period (days) or category.
2. Calculate the total expenses within a given period.
3. Calculate the total expenses for a specific category within a period.
4. Handle cases where the specified category is absent from the records.

## Approach

The main approach here is to filter the data using predicate functions and calculate totals based on the filtered data. We utilize higher-order functions to dynamically build predicate logic for filtering based on days and categories.

### Algorithm

1. **Filter**: Filters the records based on a given predicate function.
2. **ByDaysPeriod**: Builds a predicate that checks whether a record falls within the specified period.
3. **ByCategory**: Builds a predicate that checks whether a record belongs to a specified category.
4. **TotalByPeriod**: Filters the records by a specified period and sums the amounts of the filtered records.
5. **CategoryExpenses**: Filters the records by category and period and returns the total expenses for that category. If no records exist for the given category, it returns an error.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package expenses

import "errors"

// Record represents an expense record.
type Record struct {
	Day      int
	Amount   float64
	Category string
}

// DaysPeriod represents a period of days for expenses.
type DaysPeriod struct {
	From int
	To   int
}

// Filter returns the records for which the predicate function returns true.
func Filter(in []Record, predicate func(Record) bool) []Record {
	var out []Record
	for _, r := range in {
		if predicate(r) {
			out = append(out, r)
		}
	}
	return out
}

// ByDaysPeriod returns predicate function that returns true when
// the day of the record is inside the period of day and false otherwise
func ByDaysPeriod(period DaysPeriod) func(Record) bool {
	return func(rec Record) bool {
		return period.From <= rec.Day && rec.Day <= period.To
	}
}

// ByCategory returns predicate function that returns true when
// the category of the record is the same as the provided category
// and false otherwise
func ByCategory(category string) func(Record) bool {
	return func(r Record) bool {
		return r.Category == category
	}
}

// TotalByPeriod returns total amount of expenses for records
// inside the period p
func TotalByPeriod(in []Record, period DaysPeriod) float64 {
	periodExpenses := Filter(in, ByDaysPeriod(period))
	var total float64
	for _, rec := range periodExpenses {
		total += rec.Amount
	}
	return total
}

// CategoryExpenses returns total amount of expenses for records
// in category c that are also inside the period p.
// An error must be returned only if there are no records in the list that belong
// to the given category, regardless of period of time.
func CategoryExpenses(in []Record, period DaysPeriod, cat string) (float64, error) {
	categoryExpenses := Filter(in, ByCategory(cat))
	if len(categoryExpenses) == 0 {
		return 0, errors.New("unknown category")
	}
	return TotalByPeriod(categoryExpenses, period), nil
}
```

### Explanation

    1. **Record and DaysPeriod**:

        - Record represents an individual expense with details like day, amount, and category.
        DaysPeriod defines the period for which we want to calculate the expenses.
    2. **Filter**:

        - This function takes a slice of Record and a predicate function, filtering out records that do not satisfy the predicate condition.

    3. **ByDaysPeriod**:

        - Returns a predicate function that checks if a record's day falls within a specified period.

    4. **ByCategory**:

        - Returns a predicate function that checks if a record's category matches a given category.
    
    5. **TotalByPeriod**:

       - This function uses Filter with the predicate from ByDaysPeriod to filter records by day period and then calculates the total amount of expenses for that period.

    6. **CategoryExpenses**:

        - This function first filters records by category using ByCategory and then calculates the total amount of expenses for that category in the given period.
        - It returns an error if there are no records with the specified category.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - #### **Time Complexity**:
        - The time complexity for filtering is O(n) where n is the number of records, as each record is checked against the predicate.
        - The same applies to TotalByPeriod and CategoryExpenses since they rely on filtering the input records.

    - #### **Space Complexity**:

        - The space complexity is O(n) for the space needed to store the filtered records in a new slice.

    - #### **Time Complexity of Key Operations**:
        - Filter: O(n)
        - TotalByPeriod: O(n)
        - CategoryExpenses: O(n)


## Conclusion
The Expenses problem demonstrates efficient use of predicate functions and filtering techniques in Go. By separating logic into modular functions like Filter, ByDaysPeriod, and ByCategory, the solution becomes flexible and reusable for various filtering and aggregation tasks on the expense records.
