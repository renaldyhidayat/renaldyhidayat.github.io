## Problem Statement

The Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem in which we are given a set of items, each with a weight and value, and a maximum weight capacity for a knapsack. The goal is to determine the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of the items such that the total weight does not exceed the given capacity.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to explore the two main possibilities for each item:
1. **Include the item**: Add its value and reduce the remaining weight capacity.
2. **Exclude the item**: Keep the current weight capacity and move to the next item.

By considering these two options recursively and storing the results of subproblems (memoization), we can avoid redundant calculations and solve the problem efficiently.

### Algorithm

1. **Recursive Approach with Memoization**:
   - For each item, we either include it in the knapsack (if its weight does not exceed the current capacity) or exclude it.
   - The recursive function explores both options and returns the maximum possible value.
   - We use a memoization map to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If the capacity is zero or there are no more items to consider, the total value is zero.

3. **Memoization**:
   - We use a map to store the solutions to subproblems to avoid recomputing them.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package knapsack

type Item struct {
	Weight, Value int
}

func Knapsack(maxWeight int, items []Item) int {
	return knapsack(maxWeight, items, make(map[index]int))
}

type index struct {
	nElems    int
	maxWeight int
}

func knapsack(maxWeight int, items []Item, mem map[index]int) int {
	if maxWeight == 0 || len(items) == 0 {
		return 0
	}

	if sol, ok := mem[index{len(items), maxWeight}]; ok {
		return sol
	}

	lastItem := items[len(items)-1]

	var sol int

	if lastItem.Weight <= maxWeight {
		sol = max(
			lastItem.Value+knapsack(maxWeight-lastItem.Weight, items[:len(items)-1], mem),
			knapsack(maxWeight, items[:len(items)-1], mem),
		)
	} else {
		sol = knapsack(maxWeight, items[:len(items)-1], mem)
	}

	mem[index{len(items), maxWeight}] = sol
	return sol
}

func max(a, b int) int {
	if a > b {
		return a
	}

	return b
}
```

### Explanation
    - **Item Struct**: Each item has a Weight and a Value, represented by the Item struct.
    - **Recursive Function**: The knapsack function checks the base cases (no items or zero capacity) and makes recursive calls to explore both including and excluding the current item.
    - **Memoization**: The memoization map mem stores solutions for subproblems (indexed by the number of remaining items and the current capacity).
    - **Decision Making**: For each item, we choose the maximum value between including the item (if it fits in the knapsack) and excluding it.

### Time and Space Complexity
    
    - **Time Complexity**:

        - The time complexity is O(n * W), where n is the number of items and W is the maximum weight capacity. This is because each subproblem is computed once and stored in the memoization map.
    - **Space Complexity**:

        - The space complexity is O(n * W) due to the recursive call stack and memoization table that stores solutions for subproblems.

## Conclusion
The Knapsack problem is a fundamental optimization problem that can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming with memoization. This approach ensures that subproblems are solved only once, leading to an optimal solution with a manageable time complexity. The Go implementation provides a clear and concise solution to this classic problem.
