## Problem Statement

The "Leap" problem requires determining whether a given year is a leap year. A leap year occurs:
1. Every year that is divisible by 4, **except** years that are divisible by 100, **unless** the year is also divisible by 400.

Thus, the rules for a leap year are:
- If a year is divisible by 4, it might be a leap year.
- If the year is also divisible by 100, it is **not** a leap year, **unless** it is also divisible by 400.

For example:
- 1996 is a leap year because it is divisible by 4 and not by 100.
- 1900 is **not** a leap year because, while divisible by 4 and 100, it is not divisible by 400.
- 2000 is a leap year because it is divisible by 4, 100, and 400.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Check if the year is divisible by 4.
2. If it is divisible by 4, check if it is divisible by 100.
3. If it is divisible by 100, check if it is divisible by 400.
4. Return `true` if the year is a leap year, otherwise return `false`.

### Algorithm

1. **Divisible by 4**: First, check if the year is divisible by 4.
2. **Divisible by 100**: If the year is divisible by 4, check if it is divisible by 100. If it is, check if it is divisible by 400.
3. **Final Decision**: 
   - If the year is divisible by 400, return `true` (it is a leap year).
   - If it is divisible by 100 but not by 400, return `false`.
   - If it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, return `true` (it is a leap year).
   - If it is not divisible by 4, return `false`.

### Implementation in Go

Hereâ€™s the implementation of the `IsLeapYear` function in Go:

```go
package leap

// IsLeapYear checks if a given year is a leap year based on the rules of the Gregorian calendar.
func IsLeapYear(year int) bool {
	if year%4 == 0 {
		if year%100 == 0 {
			if year%400 == 0 {
				return true
			}
			return false
		}
		return true
	}
	return false
}
```


## Explanation

- **Divisibility Checks**: The function checks if the year is divisible by 4, then if divisible by 100, and finally if divisible by 400.
- **Return Logic**:
   - If year % 400 == 0, the year is a leap year.
   - If year % 100 == 0 and not divisible by 400, it is not a leap year.
   - If year % 4 == 0 and not divisible by 100, it is a leap year.
   - If the year is not divisible by 4, it is not a leap year.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(1) because the function performs a constant number of arithmetic operations regardless of the size of the input.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) as no additional memory is required beyond a few variables to store the intermediate results of the modulus operations.

## Conclusion
The "Leap" problem is a straightforward exercise in using basic arithmetic operations and control flow in Go. By following the divisibility rules for leap years, we can solve the problem efficiently in constant time and space. This is a great example of how simple logic can be applied to solve real-world date-related problems.
