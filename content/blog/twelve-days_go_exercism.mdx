## Problem Statement

The **Twelve Days of Christmas** problem requires generating the lyrics of the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas." Each verse describes a series of gifts given on each day, building on the gifts from previous days. The challenge is to output each verse of the song in the correct format, following the specific structure of the lyrics.

## Approach

To solve the Twelve Days problem, we will create two main functions: one for generating a specific verse based on the day and another for compiling the full song. The verses are cumulative, meaning each verse includes all previous gifts leading up to the specified day.

### Algorithm

1. **Verse Generation**:
   - Create a `Verse` function that takes a day number as input and returns the corresponding verse.
   - Use a pre-defined list of strings for each verse, indexed by the day number.

2. **Song Compilation**:
   - Implement a `Song` function that:
     - Loops through the numbers 1 to 12.
     - Calls the `Verse` function for each day to collect all verses.
     - Joins the verses together into a single string with appropriate line breaks.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package twelve

import "strings"

func Verse(i int) string {
	return []string{
		"On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me: a Partridge in a Pear Tree.",
		"On the second day of Christmas my true love gave to me: two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.",
		"On the third day of Christmas my true love gave to me: three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.",
		"On the fourth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.",
		"On the fifth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.",
		"On the sixth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.",
		"On the seventh day of Christmas my true love gave to me: seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.",
		"On the eighth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.",
		"On the ninth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.",
		"On the tenth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.",
		"On the eleventh day of Christmas my true love gave to me: eleven Pipers Piping, ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.",
		"On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: twelve Drummers Drumming, eleven Pipers Piping, ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.",
	}[i-1]
}

func Song() string {
	verses := make([]string, 0)
	for i := 1; i <= 12; i++ {
		verses = append(verses, Verse(i))
	}
	return strings.Join(verses, "\n")
}
```

### Explanation
    - **Verse Function**: This function returns a specific verse based on the day of Christmas passed to it as an argument. The verses are stored in a slice of strings, and we access the appropriate verse using the index.

    - **Song Function**: This function generates the full song by calling the Verse function for each day and appending the results to a slice. Finally, it joins all verses with newline characters to produce the complete song.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: O(1) for generating a specific verse since the verses are pre-defined. The Song function runs in O(n) where n is the number of days (12), iterating through all days to compile the full song.

    - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the verses in a slice during the song compilation process.

## Conclusion
The Twelve Days of Christmas problem effectively illustrates how to use data structures like slices in Go to manage repetitive and structured outputs. By encapsulating verse generation and song compilation into dedicated functions, we achieve a clean and modular design that is easy to read and maintain.
