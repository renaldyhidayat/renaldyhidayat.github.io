## Problem Statement

The **Bottle Song** problem involves generating the lyrics of a popular children's song about bottles hanging on a wall. The song follows a repetitive structure where each verse describes the number of bottles and how one falls down, leading to a new count of bottles remaining. The challenge is to generate the correct verses based on the starting number of bottles and the number to take down.

## Approach

To solve the Bottle Song problem, we will create a function that generates the lyrics for a specified number of bottles. This function will use helper functions to format the verses correctly and handle pluralization. The core of our solution will involve looping through the number of bottles and constructing each verse accordingly.

### Algorithm

1. Define an array to map numbers to their word representations (e.g., `1` to "One").
2. Create a `Recite` function that:
   - Accepts the starting number of bottles and the number to take down.
   - Loops from the starting number down to the stopping point, generating the appropriate verses.
3. Implement a `verse` function that:
   - Constructs each verse based on the current bottle count.
   - Formats the lines according to the song's structure.
4. Create a `plural` function to determine if "bottle" should be pluralized based on the count.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package bottlesong

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

var numberToWord = []string{"No", "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five",
	"Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "Ten"}

func Recite(startBottles, takeDown int) []string {
	var res []string
	stopBottles := startBottles - takeDown
	for i := startBottles; i > stopBottles; i-- {
		if i < startBottles {
			res = append(res, "")
		}
		res = append(res, verse(i)...)
	}
	return res
}

func verse(n int) []string {
	line1 := fmt.Sprintf("%s green bottle%s hanging on the wall,", numberToWord[n], plural(n))
	line2 := "And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,"
	line3 := fmt.Sprintf("There'll be %s green bottle%s hanging on the wall.",
		strings.ToLower(numberToWord[n-1]), plural(n-1))
	return []string{line1, line1, line2, line3}
}

func plural(n int) (res string) {
	if n != 1 {
		res = "s"
	}
	return res
}
```


### Explanation
    - **numberToWord**: This array stores the string representation of numbers from 0 to 10 to facilitate easy conversion from number to word.
    - **Recite**: The main function that generates the song lyrics based on the starting number of bottles and how many to take down. It constructs the output by calling the verse function for each number of bottles.
    - **verse**: This function formats and returns the lines for a given number of bottles. It handles the proper singular or plural form of "bottle."
    - **plural**: A helper function that returns "s" if the count is not one, ensuring proper grammar in the lyrics.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of bottles being recited. The function processes each bottle count to generate the respective verse.

    - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the list of strings returned by Recite, which contains the lyrics for each bottle count.

## Conclusion
The Bottle Song problem demonstrates how to construct repetitive patterns programmatically. By leveraging string formatting and a clear structure, we can efficiently generate the lyrics of the song while maintaining readability and correctness in the output. This exercise also highlights the importance of helper functions for tasks like pluralization and formatting, making our code modular and easy to manage.
