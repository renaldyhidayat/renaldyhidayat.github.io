# Lasagna Master

In the **Lasagna Master** problem, the goal is to simulate lasagna preparation by calculating the preparation time, ingredients, and scaling recipes. The problem consists of handling different aspects of the lasagna-making process efficiently using Go.

## Problem Statement

1. **Preparation Time**: Calculate the time required to prepare the lasagna layers, where each layer takes a specified amount of time to prepare.
2. **Ingredient Quantities**: Calculate the required amounts of noodles and sauce based on the layers.
3. **Secret Ingredient**: Add a secret ingredient from a friend's list to your list.
4. **Recipe Scaling**: Scale the recipe quantities based on the number of portions desired.

## Approach

For each function, we follow a direct approach using basic array and math operations. We'll walk through how to efficiently implement each of these features using Go.

### Algorithm

1. **PreparationTime**:
   - Multiply the number of layers by the time per layer. If no time is provided (or less than 1), assume a default of 2 minutes per layer.

2. **Quantities**:
   - Loop through the list of layers and count how many layers are "noodles" or "sauce" to calculate the total quantities of noodles (in grams) and sauce (in liters).

3. **AddSecretIngredient**:
   - Overwrite the last ingredient in your list with the last ingredient from a friendâ€™s list.

4. **ScaleRecipe**:
   - Multiply the base quantities by a scaling factor depending on the number of portions requested.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package lasagna

// PreparationTime calculates the total preparation time for the lasagna layers.
func PreparationTime(layers []string, timePerLayer int) int {
	if timePerLayer < 1 {
		return len(layers) * 2
	}
	return len(layers) * timePerLayer
}

// Quantities calculates the number of noodles (in grams) and sauce (in liters) needed.
func Quantities(layers []string) (noodles int, sauce float64) {
	noodles = 0
	sauce = 0.0

	for i := 0; i < len(layers); i++ {
		if layers[i] == "noodles" {
			noodles += 50
		} else if layers[i] == "sauce" {
			sauce += 0.2
		}
	}

	return
}

// AddSecretIngredient adds a secret ingredient from a friend's list to your list.
func AddSecretIngredient(friendList []string, myList []string) {
	(myList)[len(myList)-1] = friendList[len(friendList)-1]
}

// ScaleRecipe scales the quantities based on the number of portions requested.
func ScaleRecipe(quantities []float64, numberOfPortions int) []float64 {
	newQuantities := make([]float64, len(quantities))

	for i := 0; i < len(quantities); i++ {
		newQuantities[i] = quantities[i] * float64(numberOfPortions) / 2
	}

	return newQuantities
}
```

### Explanation
    1. **PreparationTime**:

        This function multiplies the number of layers by the timePerLayer. If the time per layer is less than 1, we assume the default preparation time of 2 minutes per layer.

    2. **Quantities**:

        This function loops through the list of layers. If a layer is "noodles", 50 grams are added. If a layer is "sauce", 0.2 liters are added. The result is returned as two values: noodles (in grams) and sauce (in liters).

    3. **AddSecretIngredient**:

        This function replaces the last element of the user's ingredient list (myList) with the last element of the friend's list (friendList). This allows for the secret ingredient to be transferred.

    4. **ScaleRecipe**:

        The function scales each quantity based on the desired number of portions. The scaling factor is numberOfPortions / 2 because the original recipe is for 2 portions.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - #### **Time Complexity**:

        - **PreparationTime**: O(n), where n is the number of layers.
        - **Quantities**: O(n), where n is the number of layers.
        - **AddSecretIngredient**: O(1), since it only modifies one element.
        - **ScaleRecipe**: O(n), where n is the number of ingredients in the recipe.

    - #### **Space Complexity**:

        - **PreparationTime**: O(1), constant space for the computation.
        - **Quantities**: O(1), no extra space used beyond the inputs.
        - **AddSecretIngredient**: O(1), no extra space used beyond the inputs.
        - **ScaleRecipe**: O(n), because it returns a new slice with scaled values.


## Conclusion
In the Lasagna Master problem, we implemented functions to calculate preparation time, track ingredient quantities, add a secret ingredient, and scale recipes based on the number of portions. The approach efficiently handles array operations and scaling using basic Go functionality. These solutions work in linear time for the most part and have minimal space overhead, making them suitable for small to medium inputs.
