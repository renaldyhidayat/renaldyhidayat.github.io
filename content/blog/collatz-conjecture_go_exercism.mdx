## Problem Statement

The "Collatz Conjecture," also known as the "3n + 1" problem, is a mathematical sequence that works as follows:

1. Start with any positive integer `n`.
2. If `n` is even, divide it by 2.
3. If `n` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
4. Repeat the process until `n` becomes 1.

The challenge is to determine how many steps are required to reach 1. If the input is invalid (i.e., not a positive integer), return an error.

For example:
- For `n = 12`, the sequence is 12 → 6 → 3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1, requiring 9 steps.
- For `n = 19`, it takes 20 steps to reach 1.

## Approach

We can solve this problem recursively by repeatedly applying the rules of the Collatz sequence until the value reaches 1. Additionally, input validation is required to ensure that the function only accepts positive integers.

### Algorithm

1. **Input Validation**: If `n` is less than or equal to 0, return an error because the input must be a positive integer.
2. **Recursive Function**: Define a recursive function `collatz(n)` that:
   - Returns 0 if `n == 1` (base case).
   - If `n` is even, recursively call `collatz(n/2)` and add 1 to the result.
   - If `n` is odd, recursively call `collatz(3*n + 1)` and add 1 to the result.
3. **Wrapper Function**: Use the wrapper function `CollatzConjecture(n)` to handle input validation and call the recursive function.

### Implementation in Go

Here’s the implementation of the `CollatzConjecture` function in Go:

```go
// Package collatzconjecture provides functions for reasoning about Collatz' conjecture.
package collatzconjecture

import "errors"

// CollatzConjecture returns the number of steps the Collatz sequence needs to reach 1.
// An error is returned if the input is not a positive integer.
func CollatzConjecture(n int) (int, error) {
	if n <= 0 {
		return -1, errors.New("Invalid input")
	}
	return collatz(n), nil
}

// collatz is a recursive helper function that calculates the steps for the Collatz sequence.
func collatz(n int) int {
	if n == 1 {
		return 0
	} else if n%2 == 0 {
		return 1 + collatz(n/2)
	} else {
		return 1 + collatz(3*n+1)
	}
}
```

### Explanation

- **Input Validation**: The main function CollatzConjecture(n) checks if the input n is a positive integer. If not, it returns an error.
- **Recursive Collatz Function**: The function collatz(n) handles the core logic of the Collatz sequence:
If n == 1, the function returns 0, signaling the end of the sequence.

- If n is even, the function divides n by 2 and adds 1 to the result (since this represents one step in the sequence).
- If n is odd, the function calculates 3*n + 1, adds 1 to the result, and continues the sequence.

- **Recursive Structure**: The function uses recursion to reduce the input until n == 1, tracking the number of steps.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the function is O(log n) in the best case (when n is a power of 2), as the sequence halves the input each time. In the worst case (for large numbers), the sequence takes more steps, but generally, the function runs efficiently for most values of n.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(log n) due to the recursive stack that stores intermediate results.

## Conclusion
The "Collatz Conjecture" problem offers a simple recursive approach to solve the sequence in Go. With proper input validation and a recursive function, the problem is efficiently solved. The implementation is well-suited for beginners learning about recursion and mathematical sequences in Go.
