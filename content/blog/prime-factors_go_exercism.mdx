## Problem Statement

Given an integer, the goal of the Prime Factors problem is to find all prime factors of that number. Prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original integer.

For example, the prime factors of 28 are 2, 2, and 7 because \( 28 = 2 \times 2 \times 7 \).

## Approach

To solve this problem, the approach is straightforward:
1. Start dividing the given integer by the smallest prime, which is 2.
2. If the number is divisible by 2, add 2 to the list of factors and divide the number by 2.
3. Continue this process by incrementing the divisor and dividing until the number becomes 1.

### Algorithm

1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.
2. Use a loop to divide the number by the current divisor as long as it is divisible by that divisor.
3. For each division, add the divisor to the list of factors.
4. Once the number is no longer divisible by that divisor, increment the divisor and repeat.
5. Continue this process until the number becomes 1.
6. Return the list of prime factors.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package prime

func Factors(i int64) []int64{
  var o = []int64{}

  for divisor := int64(2); i > 1; divisor++ {
    for ; i % divisor == 0; i /= divisor {
      o = append(o, divisor)
    }
  }

  return o
}
```

## Explanation
- **Divisor Loop**: The outer loop increments the divisor, starting from 2. For each divisor, the inner loop divides the input number as long as the divisor is a factor.
- **Prime Check**: We don’t explicitly check if the divisor is prime, but the nature of the algorithm ensures that only primes will appear in the output since we divide by all smaller factors first.
- **Appending Factors**: For every divisor that divides the input number, we append it to the output list o.
For example, for an input of 28:

        - Start with divisor = 2. Since 28 is divisible by 2, divide 28 by 2 and add 2 to the list.
        - Now, 14 remains. Since 14 is divisible by 2, divide again and add 2.
        - Now, 7 remains. Increment the divisor to 3, but 7 isn’t divisible by 3.
        - Increment the divisor to 7, which divides 7. Add 7 to the list, leaving 1.
        - The prime factors of 28 are [2, 2, 7].

### Time and Space Complexity

    - #### **Time Complexity**: O(sqrt(n)), where n is the input integer. This is because we only need to check divisors up to the square root of the number.

    - #### **Space Complexity**: O(log(n)), since the number of factors is proportional to the logarithm of the input number in the worst case (e.g., for a power of 2).

## Conclusion
This solution for finding prime factors in Go is efficient and easy to understand. By iterating through possible divisors and dividing the input number, we obtain the prime factors in a minimal number of steps. The time complexity of O(sqrt(n)) ensures that even large numbers can be factored efficiently.
