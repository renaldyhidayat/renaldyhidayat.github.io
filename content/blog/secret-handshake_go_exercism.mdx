## Problem Statement

The Secret Handshake problem involves creating a series of actions based on a given code represented as a binary number. Each bit in the code corresponds to a specific action, and the order of the actions may be reversed based on the highest bit. The goal is to decode the binary number into a list of actions that represent the handshake.

## Approach

To solve the Secret Handshake problem, we will:
1. Check the individual bits of the given code to determine which actions to perform.
2. Reverse the order of actions if the highest bit is set.
3. Return the resulting actions as a slice of strings.

### Algorithm

1. **Initialize an empty result slice** to hold the actions.
2. **Check each relevant bit** of the code using bitwise operations:
   - If the first bit (1) is set, add "wink" to the result.
   - If the second bit (2) is set, add "double blink" to the result.
   - If the third bit (4) is set, add "close your eyes" to the result.
   - If the fourth bit (8) is set, add "jump" to the result.
3. **Check the fifth bit (16)** to determine if the actions should be reversed.
4. **Return the result slice**.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package secret

func Handshake(code uint) []string {
	var result []string

	if code&1 == 1 {
		result = append(result, "wink")
	}

	if code&2 == 2 {
		result = append(result, "double blink")
	}

	if code&4 == 4 {
		result = append(result, "close your eyes")
	}

	if code&8 == 8 {
		result = append(result, "jump")
	}

	if code&16 == 16 {
		for i, j := 0, len(result)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
			result[i], result[j] = result[j], result[i]
		}
	}

	return result
}
```

## Explanation
    - The function Handshake takes a uint code as input.
    - It checks each action's corresponding bit:
        - The first four bits correspond to the actions "wink," "double blink," "close your eyes," and "jump."
        - If the fifth bit is set (indicating the need to reverse the order), the resulting actions are reversed.
        - Finally, the function returns the slice of strings representing the handshake actions.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of actions (up to 4) since we iterate through the relevant bits and potentially reverse the actions.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the result slice that stores the actions.

## Conclusion
The Secret Handshake problem demonstrates how to use bitwise operations to decode a binary number into specific actions. This implementation in Go efficiently translates the code into the corresponding actions, allowing for both straightforward interpretation and optional reordering based on a specific condition.
