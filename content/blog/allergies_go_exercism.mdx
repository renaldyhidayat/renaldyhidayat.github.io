## Problem Statement

Given a person's allergy score, the goal is to determine which allergens the person is allergic to. The allergy score is represented by a number, and each bit in the binary representation of that number corresponds to a different allergen.

You need to write two functions:

1. **Allergies(uint)**: Returns a list of allergens that the person is allergic to.
2. **AllergicTo(uint, string)**: Takes the allergy score and an allergen as input and returns `true` if the person is allergic to the given allergen, `false` otherwise.

The allergens and their respective bit positions are as follows:

- `0`: Eggs
- `1`: Peanuts
- `2`: Shellfish
- `3`: Strawberries
- `4`: Tomatoes
- `5`: Chocolate
- `6`: Pollen
- `7`: Cats

## Approach

### Algorithm

The idea is to use bitwise operations to determine which allergens a person is allergic to, based on the binary representation of their allergy score. Each bit in the score corresponds to a different allergen.

1. Loop through the predefined allergen list and check if the corresponding bit in the score is set to `1`. If so, add that allergen to the result.
2. To check if a specific allergen is present in the allergy score, use bitwise AND to isolate the relevant bit.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package allergies

var allergens = []string{"eggs", "peanuts", "shellfish", "strawberries", "tomatoes", "chocolate", "pollen", "cats"}

func Allergies(allergies uint) []string {
	a := []string{}

	for i := 0; i < len(allergens) && allergies != 0; i, allergies = i+1, allergies>>1 {
		if allergies&1 == 1 {
			a = append(a, allergens[i])
		}
	}

	return a
}

func AllergicTo(allergies uint, allergen string) bool {
	for i, a := range allergens {
		if a == allergen {
			return allergies&(1<<i) != 0
		}
	}

	return false
}

```

###  Explanation
    - **Allergies function**:

        - We use a loop that iterates through each allergen in the predefined list. For each iteration, we check if the current bit (starting from the least significant) is set to 1 using the bitwise AND operation (allergies & 1 == 1).
        - If the person is allergic to the current allergen, we append it to the list.
        - The loop continues by right-shifting the allergies value by 1 (allergies >> 1), effectively moving to the next allergen.

    - **AllergicTo function**:

        - This function checks if a person is allergic to a specific allergen by determining the position of that allergen in the list and then performing a bitwise AND operation on the allergies value with -the allergen's position.


### Time and Space Complexity
    - #### **Time Complexity**:

        - **Allergies**: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of allergens. This is because we are iterating over all allergens to check if the corresponding bit is set.
        - **AllergicTo**: The time complexity is O(n) for searching the allergen in the list, where n is the number of allergens. However, since the allergen list is small and constant in size, this can be considered O(1) in practice.
    
    - #### **Space Complexity**:

        - Both functions have a space complexity of O(n) due to the storage of allergens in the output list.


## Conclusion
By leveraging bitwise operations, the Allergies problem can be efficiently solved. This approach ensures that both functions are simple and performant, particularly with the use of bitwise shifts and AND operations to work with binary representations of allergy scores.
