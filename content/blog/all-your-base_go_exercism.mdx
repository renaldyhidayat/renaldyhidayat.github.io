## Problem Statement

The **All Your Base** problem involves converting a number from one base to another. Given an input base and a list of digits representing a number in that base, the goal is to convert the number to a specified output base. The bases must be greater than or equal to 2.

## Approach

To solve this problem, the approach is broken down into two steps:
1. **Convert the input digits** (which are in the input base) into an integer.
2. **Convert the integer** into digits in the output base.

### Algorithm

1. **Validation**:
   - Check that both input and output bases are greater than or equal to 2.
   - Ensure all digits in the input are valid for the input base (i.e., they must be between 0 and inputBase-1).
   
2. **Conversion to Base 10**:
   - Start by converting the input digits (which are in the input base) to a decimal (base 10) number. This can be done using positional values for each digit.

3. **Conversion to Output Base**:
   - Once the number is in base 10, convert it to the desired output base by repeatedly dividing the number by the output base and recording the remainders as the digits of the output base.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package allyourbase

import (
	"errors"
	"math"
)

func ConvertToBase(inputBase int, inputDigits []int, outputBase int) ([]int, error) {
	if inputBase < 2 {
		return []int{}, errors.New("input base must be >= 2")
	}
	if outputBase < 2 {
		return []int{}, errors.New("output base must be >= 2")
	}
	var number int
	for i := len(inputDigits) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
		d := inputDigits[i]
		if d < 0 || d >= inputBase {
			return []int{}, errors.New("all digits must satisfy 0 <= d < input base")
		}
		p := len(inputDigits) - 1 - i
		number += d * int(math.Pow(float64(inputBase), float64(p)))
	}
	if number == 0 {
		return []int{0}, nil
	}
	var digits []int
	for i := number; i > 0; i /= outputBase {
		digits = append([]int{i % outputBase}, digits...)
	}
	return digits, nil
}
```

### Explanation
Validation: The first step is to ensure that both the input and output bases are valid (i.e., they must be greater than or equal to 2). Additionally, we check that each digit in the input list is valid for the input base (the digits should be between 0 and the base minus 1).

Converting to Base 10: The function first converts the input digits, which are in the input base, into a number in base 10. This is done by multiplying each digit by the input base raised to the power of its position and summing the results.

Converting to the Output Base: Once the number is converted into base 10, it's transformed into the output base. This is done by repeatedly dividing the base 10 number by the output base, collecting the remainders, which represent the digits in the new base.

Edge Case Handling: If the input number is 0, the function directly returns [0], as 0 in any base is always 0.
