# Welcome To Tech Palace!

In this article, we will solve the "Welcome To Tech Palace!" problem from Exercism using Go. The problem revolves around creating welcome messages for customers and cleaning up old marketing messages.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this problem is to create functions that can:
1. Generate a welcome message for customers.
2. Add a decorative border around the welcome message.
3. Clean up any old marketing messages by removing unwanted characters and excess whitespace.

## Approach

To tackle this problem, we will implement three main functions:
- **WelcomeMessage**: Generates a customized welcome message for the customer.
- **AddBorder**: Adds a decorative border of asterisks around a welcome message.
- **CleanupMessage**: Cleans up any old messages by removing specific characters and whitespace.

### Implementation in Go

Below is the Go implementation of the required functions:

```go
package techpalace

import (
	"strings"
)

// WelcomeMessage returns a welcome message for the customer.
func WelcomeMessage(customer string) string {
	return "Welcome to the Tech Palace, " + strings.ToUpper(customer)
}

// AddBorder adds a border to a welcome message.
func AddBorder(welcomeMsg string, numStarsPerLine int) string {
	border := strings.Repeat("*", numStarsPerLine)
	return border + "\n" + welcomeMsg + "\n" + border
}

// CleanupMessage cleans up an old marketing message.
func CleanupMessage(oldMsg string) string {
	// Remove stars
	cleanedMsg := strings.ReplaceAll(oldMsg, "*", "")
	// Remove leading and trailing whitespaces
	cleanedMsg = strings.TrimSpace(cleanedMsg)
	return cleanedMsg
}
```

### Explanation

1. **WelcomeMessage**:

    This function takes a customer's name as input and returns a welcome message. The customer's name is converted to uppercase to give it a more prominent appearance in the message.

2. **AddBorder**:

    This function takes a welcome message and the number of stars per line as input. It constructs a border by repeating the asterisk character and returns the formatted message with the border added above and below the welcome message.

3. **CleanupMessage**:

    This function is designed to clean up old marketing messages by removing asterisks and trimming any leading or trailing whitespace. This ensures that the message is tidy and easy to read.


### Time and Space Complexity

    - **Time Complexity**:
        All functions run in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input string (for CleanupMessage, itâ€™s particularly due to string manipulation). The other functions operate in constant time O(1) as they handle a fixed amount of processing.

    - **Space Complexity**:
        The space complexity is O(n) due to the creation of new strings in the CleanupMessage function and for the welcome message and borders.


### Conclusion
In this article, we discussed how to solve the "Welcome To Tech Palace!" problem using Go. By creating functions for generating messages, adding borders, and cleaning up old messages, we can effectively manage customer interactions in a user-friendly manner. This problem highlights the importance of string manipulation and formatting in Go.
