## Problem Statement

The **Yacht** problem is based on a dice game where the goal is to score points based on different combinations of dice rolls. The task is to calculate the score of a dice roll given a specific category (e.g., "full house," "little straight," "yacht," etc.). Different categories have different scoring rules, and the function must evaluate the dice roll based on these rules.

## Approach

### Algorithm

1. **Categorize the Dice Roll**: Identify the scoring category (e.g., "full house," "yacht," "big straight").
2. **Evaluate the Dice Combination**: Count the occurrences of each die value and calculate the sum where necessary.
3. **Return the Score**: Based on the category, return the corresponding score for the dice combination.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package yacht

import (
	"log"
	"sort"
)

var (
	littleStraight = []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
	bigStraight    = []int{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
)

func Score(dice []int, category string) int {
	sort.Ints(dice)

	var sum int
	counts := map[int]int{}
	sums := map[int]int{}

	for _, die := range dice {
		sum += die
		sums[die] += die
		counts[die]++
	}

	equal := func(arr []int) bool {
		for i, v := range arr {
			if dice[i] != v {
				return false
			}
		}
		return true
	}

	switch category {
	case "big straight":
		if equal(bigStraight) {
			return 30
		}
	case "choice":
		return sum
	case "fives":
		return sums[5]
	case "four of a kind":
		if counts[dice[0]] >= 4 {
			return dice[0] * 4
		}
		if counts[dice[1]] >= 4 {
			return dice[1] * 4
		}
	case "fours":
		return sums[4]
	case "full house":
		if (counts[dice[0]] == 3 && counts[dice[4]] == 2) || (counts[dice[0]] == 2 && counts[dice[4]] == 3) {
			return sum
		}
	case "little straight":
		if equal(littleStraight) {
			return 30
		}
	case "ones":
		return sums[1]
	case "sixes":
		return sums[6]
	case "threes":
		return sums[3]
	case "twos":
		return sums[2]
	case "yacht":
		if sum == dice[0]*5 {
			return 50
		}
	default:
		log.Fatalf("unknown category: %v", category)
	}

	return 0
}
```

### Explanation
    - **Dice Sorting**: The dice array is sorted at the beginning to make comparisons easier, especially for sequences like "little straight" and "big straight."

    - **Counts and Sums**: A map counts is used to track the occurrences of each dice value, and a map sums stores the sum of the dice for each value (e.g., for fives, it holds the total sum of all fives rolled).

    - **Category Handling**: The switch statement handles different scoring categories:

        - **Big/Little Straight**: Checks if the sorted dice match a predefined straight sequence.
        - **Choice**: Simply sums up all the dice.
        - **Four of a Kind**: Checks if four dice are the same and returns the product of the die value and four.
        - **Full House**: Ensures the counts match the full house pattern (three of one value, two of another).
        - **Yacht**: Checks if all five dice are the same.
        - **Error Handling**: If an unknown category is provided, the program logs a fatal error.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: Sorting the dice takes O(5 log 5) = O(1) since there are only five dice. The rest of the operations (counting, summing) are linear, O(5), making the overall time complexity O(1).
    - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1), as the algorithm only uses a fixed amount of additional space, regardless of input size.

## Conclusion
The Yacht problem involves evaluating different scoring categories based on a dice roll. The Go implementation efficiently handles each category using a combination of sorting, counting, and conditionally summing values. With a time complexity of O(1), this solution is optimized for performance.
