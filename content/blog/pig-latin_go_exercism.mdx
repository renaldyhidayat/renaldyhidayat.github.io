## Problem Statement

Pig Latin is a simple transformation of English words. The rules of transformation are as follows:

1. If a word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), simply append "ay" to the end of the word.
2. If a word starts with certain consonant sounds (e.g., "ch", "qu", "th"), move them to the end of the word, followed by "ay".
3. Special cases include words that start with "xr" or "yt", which are treated like vowel words.
4. The task is to translate an entire sentence into Pig Latin.

## Approach

### Algorithm

1. **Split the sentence into words**: We first break the input sentence into individual words.
2. **Translate each word**:
   - If the word starts with a vowel or special consonant patterns ("xr", "yt"), simply append "ay" to the word.
   - If the word starts with a consonant sound, move the consonant sound to the end of the word and append "ay".
3. **Handle edge cases**: Ensure words starting with special consonant clusters are translated correctly (like "ch", "qu", etc.).
4. **Join the translated words**: Combine the translated words back into a sentence.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package piglatin

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

var vowels = []string{"a", "e", "i", "o", "u"}
var consonantSounds = []string{"squ", "thr", "th", "sch", "qu", "ch", "rh", "p", "k", "x", "q", "y", "m", "f", "r"}

func Sentence(sentence string) string {
	words := strings.Split(sentence, " ")
	translated := []string{}
	for _, word := range words {
		translated = append(translated, translate(word))
	}
	return strings.Join(translated, " ")
}

func translate(word string) string {
	if startsWithVowel(word) || strings.HasPrefix(word, "xr") || strings.HasPrefix(word, "yt") {
		return handleVowel(word)
	}
	if startsWithConsonantSound(word) {
		return handleConsonantSound(word)
	}
	panic(fmt.Sprintf("unhandled word %v", word))
}

func startsWithVowel(sentence string) bool {
	for _, vowel := range vowels {
		if strings.HasPrefix(sentence, vowel) {
			return true
		}
	}
	return false
}

func startsWithConsonantSound(sentence string) bool {
	for _, cs := range consonantSounds {
		if strings.HasPrefix(sentence, cs) {
			return true
		}
	}
	return false
}

func handleConsonantSound(sentence string) string {
	for _, cs := range consonantSounds {
		if strings.HasPrefix(sentence, cs) {
			return strings.TrimPrefix(sentence, cs) + cs + "ay"
		}
	}
	panic(fmt.Sprintf("could not find consonant sound prefix for sentence %v", sentence))
}

func handleVowel(sentence string) string {
	return sentence + "ay"
}
```

### Explanation
    - **Handling Vowel Words**: The function startsWithVowel checks if the word starts with a vowel (or special consonants like "xr" or "yt"). If it does, we append "ay" to the word and return it.

    - **Handling Consonant Sound Words**: The function startsWithConsonantSound checks if the word starts with specific consonant clusters (e.g., "ch", "qu", "th"). If it matches, we move the cluster to the end of the word and add "ay".

    - **Sentence Translation**: The function Sentence splits the input sentence into words, applies the Pig Latin translation to each word, and joins the translated words back into a sentence.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - #### **Time Complexity**:
        The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of characters in the sentence. We iterate over each word and check its prefix against a list of vowels or consonants, which is done in constant time.
    - #### **Space Complexity**:
        - The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input sentence. We store the translated words and the result in new strings.

## Conclusion
The Pig Latin problem demonstrates basic string manipulation in Go, utilizing loops, conditionals, and prefix matching. It can be efficiently solved with linear time complexity relative to the input sentence's length.
