## Problem Statement

The "Hamming" problem involves calculating the Hamming distance between two strings of equal length. The Hamming distance is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters in the two strings are different.

For example:
- The Hamming distance between `"karolin"` and `"kathrin"` is 3.
- If the strings are of unequal length, the function should return an error.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Ensure that the input strings are of equal length.
2. Compare the characters at each position in the two strings.
3. Count the number of positions where the characters differ.

If the strings have different lengths, return an error, as the Hamming distance is only defined for strings of equal length.

### Algorithm

1. **Input Validation**: Check if the lengths of the two strings are the same. If not, return an error.
2. **Loop Through Strings**: Loop through the characters of the strings, comparing them at each position.
3. **Count Differences**: If the characters at a given position differ, increment a counter.
4. **Return the Result**: Return the count of differences as the Hamming distance.

### Implementation in Go

Hereâ€™s the implementation of the `Distance` function in Go:

```go
package hamming

import "errors"

// Distance calculates the Hamming distance between two strings of equal length.
func Distance(a, b string) (int, error) {
	if len(a) != len(b) {
		return 0, errors.New("strings must be of equal length")
	}
	numErrors := 0

	for i := range a {
		if a[i] != b[i] {
			numErrors++
		}
	}
	return numErrors, nil
}
```

### Explanation
- **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the lengths of the two strings a and b are equal. If they are not, it returns an error with the message "strings must be of equal length".
- **Looping through Strings**: The function then loops through the characters in the strings using the range keyword. It compares the characters at each index i in both strings.
- **Counting Differences**: If the characters at a particular index differ (a[i] != b[i]), the counter numErrors is incremented.
- **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the number of differing characters, which represents the Hamming distance between the two strings.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the strings. This is because the function iterates through each character in both strings once.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1), as the function only uses a few integer variables (the error counter and the loop index) and does not require any additional memory that scales with the input size.


## Conclusion
The "Hamming" problem is a straightforward string comparison exercise that is efficiently solvable in Go. By using simple input validation and a loop, the problem can be solved in linear time with constant space complexity. This implementation is an excellent example of how to handle error checking and string manipulation in Go.
