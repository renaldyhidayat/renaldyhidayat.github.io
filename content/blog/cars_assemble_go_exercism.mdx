# Cars Assemble

In this article, we will solve the "Cars Assemble" problem, which involves calculating the production efficiency and cost for assembling cars using Go. We will cover how to calculate the number of working cars produced per hour and per minute, as well as the total cost based on the number of cars produced.

## Problem Statement

We are given an assembly line that produces cars at a certain rate per hour. However, due to some operational inefficiencies, not all cars produced are functional. Based on the production rate and the success rate, we need to determine:

1. How many working cars are produced per hour.
2. How many working cars are produced per minute.
3. The total cost of producing a given number of cars.

### Example

- If the production rate is 221 cars per hour and the success rate is 80%, how many working cars are produced?
- If we produce 37 cars, what is the total cost?

## Approach

### Algorithm

1. **Calculate working cars per hour**:
   - Multiply the production rate by the success rate to find how many functional cars are produced every hour.
   
2. **Calculate working cars per minute**:
   - Divide the hourly production rate by 60 to get the number of working cars produced per minute.
   
3. **Calculate production cost**:
   - For every 10 cars, there is a discount where the cost is \$95,000 for the group of 10 cars.
   - For the remaining cars, each car costs \$10,000.

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go implementation of the "Cars Assemble" problem:

```go
package cars

// CalculateWorkingCarsPerHour calculates how many working cars are
// produced by the assembly line every hour.
func CalculateWorkingCarsPerHour(productionRate int, successRate float64) float64 {
	successfulCars := float64(productionRate) * (successRate / 100)
	return successfulCars
}

// CalculateWorkingCarsPerMinute calculates how many working cars are
// produced by the assembly line every minute.
func CalculateWorkingCarsPerMinute(productionRate int, successRate float64) int {
	successfulCarsPerHour := CalculateWorkingCarsPerHour(productionRate, successRate)
	successfulCarsPerMinute := successfulCarsPerHour / 60
	return int(successfulCarsPerMinute)
}

// CalculateCost works out the cost of producing the given number of cars.
func CalculateCost(carsCount int) uint {
	groupsOfTen := carsCount / 10
	remainingCars := carsCount % 10
	totalCost := uint(groupsOfTen * 95000 + remainingCars * 10000)
	return totalCost
}
```

### Explanation
  #### CalculateWorkingCarsPerHour:

    - Takes the productionRate (cars per hour) and the successRate (as a percentage), then multiplies them to find the number of working cars produced per hour.
    - Example: If the production rate is 221 cars/hour and the success rate is 80%, then 221 * (80/100) = 176.8 working cars are produced per hour.

  #### CalculateWorkingCarsPerMinute:

    - Divides the result of CalculateWorkingCarsPerHour by 60 to get the number of working cars produced per minute.
    - Example: If 176.8 cars are produced per hour, then 176.8 / 60 = 2.946 cars per minute, which rounds down to 2.
  #### CalculateCost:
    - This function calculates the cost of producing cars based on a discount scheme:
        - Groups of 10 cars cost $95,000.
        - Individual cars cost $10,000 each.
    - Example: If 37 cars are produced, the cost is calculated as:
        - 3 groups of 10 cars = 3 * 95,000 = 285,000
        - 7 remaining cars = 7 * 10,000 = 70,000
        - Total cost = $285,000 + $70,000 = $355,000.

### Time and Space Complexity
        - #### **Time Complexity**:
            - **CalculateWorkingCarsPerHour** and **CalculateWorkingCarsPerMinute** run in constant time, so they have O(1) complexity.
            - **CalculateCost** also runs in constant time since it involves simple arithmetic operations, making it O(1).

        - #### **Space Complexity**:
            - All three functions use a constant amount of extra space for variables, so the space complexity is O(1).


## Conclusion
In this article, we solved the "Cars Assemble" problem using Go by calculating the number of working cars produced per hour and per minute and determining the total production cost. This problem is a great example of applying basic arithmetic and logic in Go to handle business-related tasks efficiently.
