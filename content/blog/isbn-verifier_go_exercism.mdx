## Problem Statement

The ISBN Verifier problem involves validating whether a given ISBN-10 number is valid. An ISBN (International Standard Book Number) is a unique identifier for books, and the ISBN-10 format consists of 10 characters, which can be digits from 0 to 9 or the letter 'X'. The last character can represent the number 10. The validation process involves checking the structure of the ISBN and calculating a checksum to determine its validity.

## Approach

### Algorithm

1. **Input Processing**: Remove any hyphens from the input ISBN string.
2. **Length Check**: Ensure the cleaned ISBN has exactly 10 characters.
3. **Checksum Calculation**:
   - Iterate through the first nine characters of the ISBN and convert them to integers.
   - If the last character is 'X', treat it as 10. Otherwise, ensure all characters are digits.
   - Calculate the weighted sum by multiplying each digit by its corresponding position value (from 10 to 1).
4. **Validation**: The ISBN is valid if the checksum modulo 11 equals 0.

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go implementation for validating an ISBN-10 number:

```go
package isbn

import "strings"

// IsValidISBN checks if the given ISBN-10 number is valid.
func IsValidISBN(isbnWithHypen string) bool {
	isbn := strings.ReplaceAll(isbnWithHypen, "-", "")

	if len(isbn) != 10 {
		return false
	}

	sum := 0
	multiplicator := 10

	for i := 0; i < len(isbn); i++ {
		digit := int(isbn[i] - '0')

		if !(digit >= 0 && digit <= 9) {
			if i == len(isbn)-1 && isbn[i] == 'X' {
				digit = 10
			} else {
				return false
			}
		}

		sum += digit * multiplicator
		multiplicator--
	}

	return sum%11 == 0
}
```

## Explanation

    - **Input Processing**: The function begins by removing any hyphens from the input string using strings.ReplaceAll().

    - **Length Check**: The length of the resulting string is checked to ensure it has exactly 10 characters. If not, the function returns false.

    - **Checksum Calculation**:

        - A loop iterates through the characters of the cleaned ISBN. For each character, it checks if it is a digit. If it is the last character and is 'X', it assigns it a value of 10. If it's neither, the function returns false.
        - The checksum is calculated by multiplying each digit by its position weight (starting from 10 and decreasing to 1).
        
    - **Validation**: The function returns true if the final checksum modulo 11 equals 0, indicating a valid ISBN.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - #### Time Complexity: O(n)

        - The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the ISBN string (10 in this case). The function processes each character once to validate and compute the checksum.
    - #### Space Complexity: O(1)

        - The space complexity is O(1) since the function uses a fixed amount of additional space for variables, regardless of the input size.

## Conclusion
The ISBN Verifier problem is effectively solved using a straightforward algorithm that validates the structure of the ISBN-10 format and calculates a checksum. The implementation in Go provides a clear and efficient approach to checking the validity of ISBN-10 numbers, with constant space usage and linear time complexity, making it an optimal solution for this problem.
