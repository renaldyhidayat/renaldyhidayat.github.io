# Gross Store

In the **Gross Store** problem, we manage a bill for a customer by handling different unit measurements. The task involves creating a billing system where items can be added, removed, and queried based on their unit measurements.

## Problem Statement

You need to implement a system that can:
1. Store units of measurement for various quantities.
2. Create a new bill for a customer.
3. Add items to the customer's bill using specified units.
4. Remove items from the bill.
5. Retrieve the quantity of a specific item in the bill.

## Approach

The approach consists of defining functions to manage the units, the bill, and the items on the bill. We will use maps to efficiently store and retrieve data.

### Algorithm

1. **Units**:
   - Create a function to return a map of unit measurements with their respective quantities.
   
2. **NewBill**:
   - Create a function to initialize a new, empty bill.

3. **AddItem**:
   - Check if the unit exists in the units map.
   - If it exists, add the corresponding quantity to the bill item, creating the entry if it does not already exist.

4. **RemoveItem**:
   - Check if both the item exists in the bill and the specified unit exists in the units.
   - If both conditions are met and the quantity to remove does not exceed the quantity in the bill, proceed to remove the item or decrease its count.

5. **GetItem**:
   - Retrieve the quantity of a specified item from the bill.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package gross

// Units store the Gross Store unit measurement
func Units() map[string]int {
	return map[string]int{
		"quarter_of_a_dozen": 3,
		"half_of_a_dozen":    6,
		"dozen":              12,
		"small_gross":        120,
		"gross":              144,
		"great_gross":        1728,
	}
}

// NewBill create a new bill
func NewBill() map[string]int {
	return map[string]int{}
}

// AddItem add item to customer bill
func AddItem(bill, units map[string]int, item, unit string) bool {
	pieces, exists := units[unit]

	if !exists {
		return false
	}

	bill[item] += pieces
	return true
}

// RemoveItem remove item from customer bill
func RemoveItem(bill, units map[string]int, item, unit string) bool {
	rpieces, rexists := units[unit]
	bpieces, bexists := bill[item]

	if !rexists || !bexists || rpieces > bpieces {
		return false
	} else if rpieces == bpieces {
		delete(bill, item)
	} else {
		bill[item] -= rpieces
	}

	return true
}

// GetItem return the quantity of item that the customer has in his/her bill
func GetItem(bill map[string]int, item string) (int, bool) {
	pieces, exists := bill[item]
	return pieces, exists
}
```

### Explanation

    1. **Units**:

        The Units function returns a predefined map that contains the unit measurements available in the Gross Store and their corresponding quantities.

    2. **NewBill**:

        The NewBill function initializes a new map to represent an empty bill for a customer.

    3. **AddItem**:

        The AddItem function checks if the specified unit exists. If it does, it adds the number of pieces associated with that unit to the bill for the specified item. If the item doesnâ€™t exist in the bill, it initializes its quantity.

    4. **RemoveItem**:

        The RemoveItem function checks if the item exists in the bill and if the unit exists in the units. If both checks pass and the quantity to remove does not exceed the current quantity in the bill, it updates the bill accordingly, either reducing the quantity or deleting the item entirely.

    5. **GetItem**:

        The GetItem function retrieves the quantity of the specified item in the bill, returning both the quantity and a boolean indicating whether the item exists.

### Time and Space Complexity

    - #### **Time Complexity**:

        - All operations (adding, removing, retrieving items) take O(1) time on average due to the nature of map operations in Go, making these functions efficient.


    - #### **Space Complexity**:

        - The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of unique items in the bill, as we store the items and their quantities in a map.


## Conclusion
The Gross Store problem provides a practical application for managing quantities of items using unit measurements. The implementation utilizes maps in Go to efficiently handle adding, removing, and querying items in a customer's bill, demonstrating effective use of data structures for simple billing systems.
