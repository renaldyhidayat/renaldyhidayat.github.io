## Problem Statement

A **perfect number** is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. Similarly, numbers can be classified into three categories based on the sum of their divisors:

1. **Perfect Number**: The sum of the divisors equals the number.
2. **Abundant Number**: The sum of the divisors is greater than the number.
3. **Deficient Number**: The sum of the divisors is less than the number.

The goal is to implement a function that classifies a given number into one of these categories.

## Approach

### Algorithm

To classify a number `n`, the following steps are performed:

1. **Check if the number is positive**: If the number is not positive, return an error.
2. **Find the sum of divisors**: Iterate from 1 to `n-1`, and sum up all divisors (numbers that divide `n` evenly).
3. **Classify the number**: Compare the sum of divisors to `n`:
   - If the sum is less than `n`, the number is **Deficient**.
   - If the sum is equal to `n`, the number is **Perfect**.
   - If the sum is greater than `n`, the number is **Abundant**.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package perfect

import "errors"

// Define the Classification type here.
var ErrOnlyPositive = errors.New("positive number is required")

type Classification int

const (
    ClassificationDeficient Classification = iota
    ClassificationPerfect
    ClassificationAbundant
)

func Classify(n int64) (Classification, error) {
    if n <= 0 {
        return 0, ErrOnlyPositive
    }

    var sum int64

    for i := n - 1; i > 0; i-- {
        if n % i == 0 {
            sum += i
        }
    }

    switch {
    case sum < n:
        return ClassificationDeficient, nil
    case sum > n:
        return ClassificationAbundant, nil
    default:
        return ClassificationPerfect, nil
    }
}
```

### Explanation
    - **Classification Type**:
        - We define a Classification type as an integer with three possible constants: ClassificationDeficient, ClassificationPerfect, and ClassificationAbundant.
    
    - **Classify Function**:
        - First, it checks if the number is positive, returning an error if it's not.
        It calculates the sum of divisors by iterating from n-1 to 1 and checking if the divisor divides n evenly (n % i == 0).
        - Depending on the value of the sum relative to n, it returns one of the three classifications.

### Time and Space Complexity
    
    - #### **Time Complexity**:

        - The time complexity is O(n) because we iterate over all numbers from n-1 to 1 to check if they divide n.
    - #### **Space Complexity**:

        - The space complexity is O(1), as no additional space is used besides a few variables for storing the sum and classification.

## Conclusion
The Perfect Number problem can be efficiently solved by iterating over divisors and comparing the sum of divisors to the given number. The approach is simple and easy to implement in Go with linear time complexity.
