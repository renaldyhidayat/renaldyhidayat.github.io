## Problem Statement

The State of Tic Tac Toe problem involves determining the current state of a Tic Tac Toe game based on a 3x3 board representation. The game can be in one of three states: "win", "draw", or "ongoing". The goal is to validate the board and return the correct state, taking into account the rules of Tic Tac Toe.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we will:
1. **Count Players**: Count the occurrences of 'O' and 'X' to ensure the game is valid.
2. **Check Wins**: Determine if either player has won.
3. **Return State**: Return the appropriate game state based on the counts and win checks.

### Algorithm

1. **Count Player Symbols**: Count how many times 'O' and 'X' appear on the board.
2. **Validate Counts**: Ensure the counts are valid according to Tic Tac Toe rules (the difference in counts should not exceed 1).
3. **Check Winning Conditions**: Check all rows, columns, and diagonals to see if either player has won.
4. **Determine State**:
   - If both players have winning conditions, the board is invalid.
   - If one player has won, return "win".
   - If the board is full (9 moves), return "draw".
   - If none of the above, return "ongoing".

### Implementation in Go

```go
package stateoftictactoe

import "fmt"

type State string

const (
	Win     State = "win"
	Ongoing State = "ongoing"
	Draw    State = "draw"
)

const PlayerO byte = 'O'
const PlayerX byte = 'X'

func StateOfTicTacToe(board []string) (State, error) {
	OCount := CountPlayer(board, PlayerO)
	XCount := CountPlayer(board, PlayerX)

	if !(OCount == XCount || XCount == OCount+1) {
		return "", fmt.Errorf("game board invalid")
	}

	OWin := WinPlayer(board, PlayerO)
	XWin := WinPlayer(board, PlayerX)

	if OWin && XWin {
		return "", fmt.Errorf("game board invalid")
	}

	if OWin || XWin {
		return Win, nil
	}

	if OCount+XCount == 9 {
		return Draw, nil
	}

	return Ongoing, nil
}

func CountPlayer(board []string, player byte) int {
	count := 0
	for r := 0; r < 3; r++ {
		for c := 0; c < 3; c++ {
			if player == board[r][c] {
				count += 1
			}
		}
	}
	return count
}

func WinPlayer(board []string, player byte) bool {
	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		if player == board[i][0] && player == board[i][1] && player == board[i][2] {
			return true
		}
		if player == board[0][i] && player == board[1][i] && player == board[2][i] {
			return true
		}
	}
	if player == board[0][0] && player == board[1][1] && player == board[2][2] {
		return true
	}
	if player == board[2][0] && player == board[1][1] && player == board[0][2] {
		return true
	}
	return false
}
```

### Explanation
    - **State Representation**: The State type defines the possible states of the game.
    - **Count Players**: The CountPlayer function counts the occurrences of a given player on the board.
    - **Win Check**: The WinPlayer function checks if a specified player has won by checking all rows, columns, and diagonals.
    - **Main Logic**: The StateOfTicTacToe function consolidates these checks, determining the game's state while ensuring the board is valid.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**:
        - Counting players is O(1) since it involves a fixed number of operations (checking a 3x3 grid).
        - Checking for wins is O(1) as it also checks a fixed number of conditions.
    
    - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

## Conclusion
The State of Tic Tac Toe problem can be efficiently implemented in Go by leveraging straightforward algorithms for counting player moves and checking winning conditions. By ensuring the board's validity, the program accurately reflects the game's current state, providing a clear and efficient solution.
