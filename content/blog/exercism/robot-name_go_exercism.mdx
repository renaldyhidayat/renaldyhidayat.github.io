## Problem Statement

The problem requires us to generate a unique name for each robot, following a specific format: two uppercase letters followed by three digits (e.g., "AB123"). Additionally, the system must support resetting the robot's name, which should allow the robot to generate a new unique name if needed.

We need to ensure that the name generation is efficient and that the names are unique within a defined limit.

## Approach

1. **Robot Name Generation**:
   - Each robot must have a unique name in the format of two letters followed by three digits (e.g., "AA000" to "ZZ999").
   
2. **Unique Name Constraint**:
   - Ensure names are unique by keeping track of previously assigned names.
   - There is a limit to the number of unique names, which is calculated as `26 * 26 * 1000 = 676,000` names.

3. **Reset Functionality**:
   - Implement a `Reset` method that allows a robot to reset its name and get a new unique name.

### Algorithm

1. **Name Generation**:
   - Randomly generate two uppercase letters followed by three digits.
   - Check if the name is already taken by using a map to track used names.
   
2. **Check for Maximum Names**:
   - Ensure that the maximum number of names is not exceeded.
   
3. **Reset Functionality**:
   - If the robot's name is reset, the system should generate a new unique name for the robot.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package robotname

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"strings"
	"time"
)

const SOURCE = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRXTUVWXYZ"
const MAX_NAMES = 26 * 26 * 1000

var robotNames = make(map[string]string, MAX_NAMES)

type Robot struct {
	name string
}

func (r *Robot) Name() (string, error) {
	if r.name == "" {
		name, err := createName()

		if err != nil {
			return "", err
		}

		if _, ok := robotNames[name]; ok {
			name, _ = r.Name()
		}

		r.name = name
		robotNames[name] = name
	}
	return r.name, nil
}

func (r *Robot) Reset() {
	r.name = ""
}

func createName() (string, error) {
	if len(robotNames) == MAX_NAMES {
		return "", errors.New("maximum number of names reached")
	}

	rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano())
	no := rand.Intn(1000)
	robotName := strings.ToUpper(string(SOURCE[rand.Intn(25)]) + string(SOURCE[rand.Intn(25)]))
	newName := fmt.Sprintf("%s%03d", robotName, no)

	return newName, nil
}
```

### Explanation
    - **Robot Struct**: The Robot type contains a name field to store the robot's unique name. This struct has methods to get the name and reset it.

    - **Name Method**:

        - This method generates a name if the robot does not have one yet.
        - It calls createName() to generate a new name and checks for uniqueness using the robotNames map.
    
    - **Reset Method**:

        - When the Reset() function is called, it clears the robot's name so that a new one can be generated when Name() is called again.
    
    - **createName Function**:

        - This function generates a random name consisting of two uppercase letters and three digits.
        - It ensures uniqueness by checking the robotNames map.
        - If the number of unique names has reached its limit, an error is returned.

### Time and Space Complexity

    - #### **Time Complexity**:

        - Name generation is O(1) because it involves generating a random name and checking its uniqueness in a map.
        - The reset operation is also O(1).

    - #### **Space Complexity**:

        - O(n) where n is the number of unique robot names generated. This space is used to store the robot names in a map for checking uniqueness.

## Conclusion
This solution efficiently handles robot name generation while ensuring uniqueness across robots. It provides a reset functionality and leverages random name generation with O(1) operations for both name generation and resetting, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
