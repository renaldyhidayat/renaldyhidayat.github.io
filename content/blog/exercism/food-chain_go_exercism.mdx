## Problem Statement

The **Food Chain** problem involves recreating the verses of a classic cumulative song where an old lady swallows increasingly absurd animals. The song follows a structure where each verse adds a new animal and repeats the reasons for swallowing the previous animals. The challenge is to generate specific verses or the entire song programmatically.

## Approach

### Algorithm

1. **Verse Construction**: Each verse follows a pattern:
    - It starts by mentioning the animal the lady swallows.
    - It adds a unique line for the animal, if applicable.
    - It repeats the reasoning chain for swallowing previous animals.
    - The song ends after the eighth verse where she swallows a horse and dies.

2. **Verse Generation**: The function constructs each verse by adding the new animal, optional description, and the cascading reasons for swallowing the animals. The final verse does not follow the same pattern as the others.

3. **Efficient Reuse**: Each animal's data (name, unique lines, and reasoning) is stored in a structure for easy access. This allows each verse to be built efficiently.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package foodchain

import "strings"

var words = []struct {
	animal string
	once   string
	repeat string
}{
	{
		"fly",
		"",
		"I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.",
	},
	{
		"spider",
		"It wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.",
		"She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.",
	},
	{
		"bird",
		"How absurd to swallow a bird!",
		"She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.",
	},
	{
		"cat",
		"Imagine that, to swallow a cat!",
		"She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.",
	},
	{
		"dog",
		"What a hog, to swallow a dog!",
		"She swallowed the dog to catch the cat.",
	},
	{
		"goat",
		"Just opened her throat and swallowed a goat!",
		"She swallowed the goat to catch the dog.",
	},
	{
		"cow",
		"I don't know how she swallowed a cow!",
		"She swallowed the cow to catch the goat.",
	},
	{
		"horse",
		"She's dead, of course!",
		"",
	},
}

func Verse(v int) string {
	verse := []string{"I know an old lady who swallowed a " + words[v-1].animal + "."}

	if v > 1 {
		verse = append(verse, words[v-1].once)
	}

	for i := v - 1; v < 8 && i >= 0; i-- {
		verse = append(verse, words[i].repeat)
	}

	return strings.Join(verse, "\n")
}

func Verses(start, end int) string {
	var verses []string

	for i := start; i <= end; i++ {
		verses = append(verses, Verse(i))
	}

	return strings.Join(verses, "\n\n")
}

func Song() string {
	return Verses(1, 8)
}
```

### Explanation
    - **Data Structure**: A slice of structs holds the animal names and corresponding lines. Each animal has a unique once line that appears in its respective verse and a repeat line that is used for chaining with previous animals.

    - **Verse Function**:

        - Verse(v int) generates a single verse. It starts with the new animal and adds the appropriate lines. If there are preceding animals, it appends the cascading reasons.
        
    - **Verses Function**:

        - Verses(start, end int) generates a range of verses by calling the Verse function for each verse number from start to end.
    - **Song Function**:

        - Song() outputs all verses from 1 to 8 by calling the Verses function.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**:
        - Constructing each verse requires iterating through the animal data and appending strings. Since there are a constant number of verses and animals (8 animals, with each verse containing up to 8 lines), the time complexity is O(1).
    - **Space Complexity**:
        - The space complexity is O(1) since the memory usage for storing the verses and the song structure is constant with respect to input size

## Conclusion
The Food Chain problem demonstrates how to generate structured, repetitive text using predefined patterns and simple loops. By storing the verse data in a reusable format, the problem can be solved efficiently in terms of both time and space complexity.
