## Problem Statement

In this problem, we are tasked with calculating a person's age on different planets in the solar system based on the number of seconds they have lived. Each planet has a different orbital period, which affects how age is calculated.

The goal is to create a function that takes in a person's age in seconds and a planet's name, then returns the equivalent age on that planet.

### Orbital Periods

The following are the orbital periods of the planets in Earth years:

| Planet   | Orbital Period (Earth Years) |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| Mercury  | 0.2408467                     |
| Venus    | 0.61519726                    |
| Earth    | 1                             |
| Mars     | 1.8808158                     |
| Jupiter  | 11.862615                     |
| Saturn   | 29.447498                     |
| Uranus   | 84.016846                     |
| Neptune  | 164.79132                     |

## Approach

To solve this problem, we will implement a function called `Age`. This function will:

1. Convert the age in seconds to Earth years.
2. Calculate the equivalent age on the specified planet using the planet's orbital period.

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go implementation for the Space Age problem:

```go
package space

// Planet type
type Planet string

// Age of person on a given planet
func Age(seconds float64, planet Planet) float64 {
	earthAge := seconds / 31557600
	switch planet {
	case "Mercury":
		return earthAge / 0.2408467
	case "Venus":
		return earthAge / 0.61519726
	case "Earth":
		return earthAge
	case "Mars":
		return earthAge / 1.8808158
	case "Jupiter":
		return earthAge / 11.862615
	case "Saturn":
		return earthAge / 29.447498
	case "Uranus":
		return earthAge / 84.016846
	case "Neptune":
		return earthAge / 164.79132
	default:
		return -1
	}
}
```

### Explanation
	- **Planet Type**: We define a custom type Planet as a string to represent the different planets in our function.

	- **Age Function**: This function takes two parameters: the age in seconds and the planet. It first calculates the Earth age by dividing the seconds by the number of seconds in a year (approximately 31,557,600). It then uses a switch statement to determine the age on the specified planet by dividing the Earth age by the planet's orbital period.

### Time and Space Complexity

	- **Time Complexity**: O(1), as the function performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input size.

	- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the space used by the function does not change with the size of the input; it only returns a single float value.

## Conclusion
The Space Age problem is a practical application of basic arithmetic and conditional logic in programming. By understanding the differences in planetary orbital periods, we can easily calculate a person's age on various planets. This implementation in Go is efficient and straightforward, showcasing how to handle different types and calculations effectively.
