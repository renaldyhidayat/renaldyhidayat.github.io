# Interest is Interesting

In the **Interest is Interesting** problem, the task is to compute interest on a balance, update the balance annually, and determine how many years it will take to reach a desired balance. The calculations are based on dynamic interest rates depending on the current balance.

## Problem Statement

1. **Interest Rate**: Compute the interest rate based on a balance using a tiered system.
2. **Interest Calculation**: Calculate the interest for a given balance.
3. **Annual Balance Update**: Update the balance annually, accounting for the earned interest.
4. **Years Before Desired Balance**: Calculate how many years it will take for a balance to reach a target amount.

## Approach

The core of this problem involves tiered interest rates and balance updates. Weâ€™ll take the following approach:

1. **InterestRate**: This function uses conditional logic to return different interest rates based on the balance.
2. **Interest**: This function multiplies the balance by the interest rate to calculate the annual interest.
3. **AnnualBalanceUpdate**: This function adds the interest to the balance to calculate the updated balance after a year.
4. **YearsBeforeDesiredBalance**: This function repeatedly applies the annual balance update until the target balance is reached, counting the number of years.

### Algorithm

1. **InterestRate**: 
   - Use conditional checks to determine which interest rate applies based on the current balance.
   
2. **Interest**:
   - Multiply the balance by the interest rate (converted to a percentage) to compute the interest.

3. **AnnualBalanceUpdate**:
   - Add the interest to the current balance to update it for the year.

4. **YearsBeforeDesiredBalance**:
   - Loop through each year, applying the annual update until the balance meets or exceeds the target balance.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package interest

// InterestRate returns the interest rate for the provided balance.
func InterestRate(balance float64) float32 {
    if balance < 0 {
        return 3.213
    } else if balance < 1000 {
    	return 0.5
    } else if balance < 5000 {
    	return 1.621
    } else {
    	return 2.475
    }
}

// Interest calculates the interest for the provided balance.
func Interest(balance float64) float64 {
	return balance * float64(InterestRate(balance)) / 100
}

// AnnualBalanceUpdate calculates the annual balance update, taking into account the interest rate.
func AnnualBalanceUpdate(balance float64) float64 {
	return balance + Interest(balance)
}

// YearsBeforeDesiredBalance calculates the minimum number of years required to reach the desired balance.
func YearsBeforeDesiredBalance(balance, targetBalance float64) int {
	i := 0
    for balance < targetBalance {
        balance = AnnualBalanceUpdate(balance)
        i++
    }
	return i
}
```

### Explanation

    1. **InterestRate**:

        - The interest rate is tiered. If the balance is negative, the interest rate is 3.213%. If the balance is less than 1000, the interest rate is 0.5%. For balances between 1000 and 5000, the interest rate is 1.621%. For balances above 5000, the interest rate is 2.475%.

    2. **Interest**:

        - This function computes the interest for a given balance by multiplying the balance by the interest rate and dividing by 100 (to account for percentage).

    3. **AnnualBalanceUpdate**:

        - The annual update adds the interest to the balance for a given year. The interest is calculated by calling the Interest function.

    4. **YearsBeforeDesiredBalance**:

        - This function applies the balance update in a loop, counting how many years it takes for the balance to meet or exceed the desired balance. Each year, the balance increases by the interest earned.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - #### **Time Complexity**:

        - **InterestRate**: O(1), constant time since it only checks a few conditions.
        - **Interest**: O(1), constant time as it performs basic arithmetic.
        - **AnnualBalanceUpdate**: O(1), constant time since it performs a fixed set of operations.
        - **YearsBeforeDesiredBalance**: O(n), where n is the number of years required to reach the desired balance. Each year, the balance is updated until it meets the target.

    - #### **Space Complexity**:
    
        - All functions use constant space, O(1), as they only require a few variables for their calculations.

## Conclusion
The Interest is Interesting problem demonstrates how to compute interest and update balances based on dynamic interest rates. By using simple arithmetic and loops, we calculate the time it takes for a balance to grow to a target value. This approach handles a wide range of balances and interest rates efficiently. The solution scales linearly with the number of years needed to reach the target balance.
