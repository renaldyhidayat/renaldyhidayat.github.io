# Bird Watcher

The **Bird Watcher** problem requires calculating bird counts over days and weeks, as well as adjusting the bird count log to correct some data. We will explore efficient solutions for these tasks using Go.

## Problem Statement

You are given daily bird counts for a certain period. The tasks are:
1. Calculate the total bird count over all days.
2. Calculate the bird count for a specific week.
3. Correct the bird count log for alternate days by increasing the count on every alternate day.

## Approach

We will solve these problems using basic array (slice) manipulation techniques. The solutions involve:
- Summing the values of the slice.
- Slicing and summing specific parts of the array for weekly counts.
- Looping through the slice and modifying elements on alternate days to fix the count.

### Algorithm

1. **TotalBirdCount**:
   - Sum the elements of the array to get the total number of birds over the entire period.

2. **BirdsInWeek**:
   - Use the week number to calculate the start and end indices for that week in the slice. Sum the bird counts from `start` to `end`.

3. **FixBirdCountLog**:
   - Iterate through the slice and increment the bird count on alternate days.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package birdwatcher

// TotalBirdCount returns the total bird count by summing
// the individual day's counts.
func TotalBirdCount(birdsPerDay []int) int {
	count := 0
	for i := 0; i < len(birdsPerDay); i++ {
		count += birdsPerDay[i]
	}
	return count
}

// BirdsInWeek returns the total bird count by summing
// only the items belonging to the given week.
func BirdsInWeek(birdsPerDay []int, week int) int {
	count := 0
	startOfWeek := (week - 1) * 7
	endOfWeek := startOfWeek + 7
	for i := startOfWeek; i < endOfWeek; i++ {
		count += birdsPerDay[i]
	}
	return count
}

// FixBirdCountLog returns the bird counts after correcting
// the bird counts for alternate days.
func FixBirdCountLog(birdsPerDay []int) []int {
	for i := 0; i < len(birdsPerDay); i += 2 {
		birdsPerDay[i]++
	}
	return birdsPerDay
}
```


### Explanation

1. **TotalBirdCount**::

    - The function iterates over the birdsPerDay slice and sums up all the elements. Each element in the slice represents the bird count for a day. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the slice.

2. **BirdsInWeek**:

    - The function calculates the total bird count for a given week. A week is represented as a range of 7 days in the birdsPerDay slice. We calculate the start and end indices for the week and sum the elements in that range. The complexity for this function is also O(n), where n is the size of the slice.

3. **FixBirdCountLog**:

    - To fix the bird count log, we iterate over the slice and increase the bird count on every alternate day (even indices). This operation has a time complexity of O(n).

### Time and Space Complexity

    - #### **Time Complexity**:

        - **TotalBirdCount**: O(n) because we sum all elements of the array.
        - **BirdsInWeek**: O(7) since we sum a fixed number of 7 elements each time.
        - **FixBirdCountLog**: O(n) because we traverse the entire array once to adjust the values on alternate days.

    - #### **Space Complexity**:

        - All functions operate in O(1) extra space, since we only use a few variables aside from the input slice.

## Conclusion
In the Bird Watcher problem, we solved the tasks of calculating the total bird count, weekly bird counts, and fixing the bird count log using basic slice manipulation techniques in Go. These functions run efficiently in linear time for most cases and require minimal extra space.
