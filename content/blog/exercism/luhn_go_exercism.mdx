## Problem Statement

The Luhn algorithm, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm, is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers. The algorithm works by verifying a sequence of digits based on specific rules. Given a string of digits, we need to determine whether it constitutes a valid Luhn code.

### Rules of the Luhn Algorithm:

1. Starting from the rightmost digit, double the value of every second digit.
2. If doubling the digit results in a number greater than 9, subtract 9 from the result.
3. Sum all the digits (the undoubled digits and the adjusted digits).
4. The total must be a multiple of 10 for the number to be valid.

## Approach

To implement the Luhn algorithm, we need to process the string from right to left, keeping track of the index to know which digits to double. We will sum up the digits according to the Luhn rules and finally check if the sum is a multiple of 10.

### Algorithm Steps:

1. Initialize variables for the total sum, digit count, and a multiplier.
2. Iterate through the string in reverse:
   - Ignore spaces.
   - If the character is a digit, convert it to an integer.
   - Double the value of every second digit.
   - If the result is greater than 9, subtract 9.
   - Add the value to the total sum.
   - Increment the digit count.
3. At the end of the iteration, check that the total sum is a multiple of 10 and that at least two digits were processed.

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go implementation of the Luhn algorithm:

```go
package luhn

// Valid determines whether the digits in the given string constitute a valid Luhn code
func Valid(s string) bool {
    var n, d, i, m int
    for i = len(s) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
        c := s[i]
        switch {
        case c == ' ':
            continue
        case c >= '0' && c <= '9':
            m = int(c - '0')
            if d%2 == 1 {
                m <<= 1 // Double the value of every second digit
            }
            if m > 9 {
                m -= 9 // Subtract 9 if the result is greater than 9
            }
            n += m // Add to the total sum
            d++ // Increment digit count
        default:
            return false // Invalid character
        }
    }
    return d > 1 && n%10 == 0 // Check validity
}
```

### Explanation
    - The Valid function processes the input string, iterating from the last character to the first.
    It uses a switch statement to handle spaces and digits, applying the Luhn algorithm rules.
    - The result is determined by checking that at least two digits were processed and that the total sum is a multiple of 10.


### Time and Space Complexity

    - **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of characters in the input string. Each character is processed exactly once.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

## Conclusion
The Luhn algorithm is a straightforward method to validate identification numbers. The Go implementation efficiently handles the input and adheres to the algorithm's rules. This solution demonstrates how simple algorithms can effectively solve real-world problems in a concise and efficient manner.
