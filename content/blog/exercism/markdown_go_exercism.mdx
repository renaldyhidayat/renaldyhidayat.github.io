## Problem Statement

The Markdown problem requires transforming a simplified version of Markdown syntax into HTML. This includes handling headers, emphasis, strong emphasis, and unordered lists. The function should take a Markdown string as input and produce an HTML string as output, ensuring that the structure and formatting are preserved.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we will:
1. **Parse the Markdown**: Read through the input Markdown string character by character, identifying elements like headers, emphasis, and lists.
2. **Construct HTML**: Build the corresponding HTML structure based on the Markdown syntax encountered.
3. **Handle Edge Cases**: Ensure that transitions between different elements (like headers and lists) are properly formatted.

### Algorithm

1. **Initialize State Variables**: Track the current state (e.g., header level, list status).
2. **Iterate Through Characters**: Use a loop to process each character in the Markdown string:
   - Identify header levels based on the number of `#` characters.
   - Detect and format emphasis (`_` and `__`) and lists (`*`).
   - Handle line breaks and transitions between elements.
3. **Finalize HTML**: Append closing tags as needed and return the constructed HTML string.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package markdown

// implementation to refactor

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

// Render translates markdown to HTML
func Render(markdown string) string {
	header := 0
	markdown = strings.Replace(markdown, "__", "<strong>", 1)
	markdown = strings.Replace(markdown, "__", "</strong>", 1)
	markdown = strings.Replace(markdown, "_", "<em>", 1)
	markdown = strings.Replace(markdown, "_", "</em>", 1)
	pos := 0
	list := 0
	listOpened := false
	html := ""
	he := false
	for {
		char := markdown[pos]
		if char == '#' {
			for char == '#' {
				header++
				pos++
				char = markdown[pos]
			}
			if header == 7 {
				html += fmt.Sprintf("<p>%s ", strings.Repeat("#", header))
			} else if he {
				html += "# "
				header--
			} else {
				html += fmt.Sprintf("<h%d>", header)
			}
			pos++
			continue
		}
		he = true
		if char == '*' && header == 0 && strings.Contains(markdown, "\n") {
			if list == 0 {
				html += "<ul>"
			}
			list++
			if !listOpened {
				html += "<li>"
				listOpened = true
			} else {
				html += string(char) + " "
			}
			pos += 2
			continue
		}
		if char == '\n' {
			if listOpened && strings.LastIndex(markdown, "\n") == pos && strings.LastIndex(markdown, "\n") > strings.LastIndex(markdown, "*") {
				html += "</li></ul><p>"
				listOpened = false
				list = 0
			}
			if list > 0 && listOpened {
				html += "</li>"
				listOpened = false
			}
			if header > 0 {
				html += fmt.Sprintf("</h%d>", header)
				header = 0
			}
			pos++
			continue
		}
		html += string(char)
		pos++
		if pos >= len(markdown) {
			break
		}
	}
	switch {
	case header == 7:
		return html + "</p>"
	case header > 0:
		return html + fmt.Sprintf("</h%d>", header)
	}
	if list > 0 {
		return html + "</li></ul>"
	}
	if strings.Contains(html, "<p>") {
		return html + "</p>"
	}
	return "<p>" + html + "</p>"

}
```

## Explanation
    - **Entry Struct**: The Entry struct represents a financial entry with fields for date, description, and change amount in cents.
    - **FormatLedger Function**: This function processes the list of entries, sorts them, and formats them according to the specified locale and currency. It also uses channels for concurrent processing of entry formatting.
    - **Error Handling**: The function includes error handling to manage incorrect date formats and unsupported locales.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: The sorting operation has a time complexity of O(n log n) where n is the number of entries. Formatting and validation may add additional linear complexity.
    - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) due to the need to store formatted strings and the use of a channel for concurrency.

## Conclusion
The Ledger problem can be effectively solved using Go by employing proper data structures and sorting algorithms. By leveraging concurrency, we can enhance the performance of the formatting process, ensuring that our solution is both efficient and easy to maintain.
