## Problem Statement

The Rail Fence Cipher is a form of transposition cipher that encodes a message by writing it in a zigzag pattern across multiple "rails." The encoded message is then read off row by row. The decoding process involves reconstructing the zigzag pattern to retrieve the original message.

Given a string to encode or decode and the number of rails, implement the Rail Fence Cipher in Go.

## Approach

To encode and decode the message using the Rail Fence Cipher, we will:
1. Use a two-dimensional representation to store characters in their respective rails.
2. Traverse the message in a zigzag manner for encoding and then read it row by row.
3. For decoding, we will reconstruct the original pattern using the encoded message and the number of rails.

### Algorithm

1. **Encoding**:
   - Create an output byte slice of the same length as the input string.
   - Traverse the input string in a zigzag pattern based on the number of rails.
   - Populate the output byte slice accordingly.
  
2. **Decoding**:
   - Create an output byte slice of the same length as the input string.
   - Calculate the positions of the characters in the zigzag pattern.
   - Fill in the output byte slice using the encoded string based on these positions.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package railfence

func Encode(s string, numRails int) string {
	return transform(s, numRails, func(in string, out []byte, i, j int) { out[i] = in[j] })
}

func Decode(s string, numRails int) string {
	return transform(s, numRails, func(in string, out []byte, j, i int) { out[i] = in[j] })
}

func transform(in string, numRails int, set func(string, []byte, int, int)) string {
	out := make([]byte, len(in))

	for i, rail := 0, 0; rail < numRails; rail++ {
		delta := 2 * rail

		for j := rail; j < len(in); j, i = j+delta, i+1 {
			set(in, out, i, j)

			if delta != 2*(numRails-1) {
				delta = 2*(numRails-1) - delta
			}
		}
	}

	return string(out)
}
```


### Explanation
    - **Encode Function**: This function utilizes the transform helper function, which takes the input string and writes it into an output byte slice in a zigzag pattern.
    - **Decode Function**: Similar to the encoding, but it fills the output based on the previously encoded message.
    - **Transform Function**: Handles the core logic for both encoding and decoding. It calculates the zigzag traversal and applies the provided set function to populate the output.

### Time and Space Complexity

    - #### Time Complexity:
        - Both Encode and Decode: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. Each character is processed a constant number of times.
        
    - #### Space Complexity:
        - O(n) for the output byte slice used to store the encoded or decoded string.

## Conclusion
The Rail Fence Cipher provides a simple yet effective method for encoding and decoding messages using a zigzag pattern. This implementation in Go efficiently handles the process, ensuring that the encoded message can be easily decoded back to its original form.
