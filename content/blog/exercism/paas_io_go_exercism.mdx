## Problem Statement

The PaaS I/O problem involves creating a system to track the number of bytes read and written to streams in Go. This tracking system should provide concurrent access while ensuring thread safety, allowing multiple goroutines to perform read and write operations simultaneously.

## Approach

To address the PaaS I/O problem, we will:
1. Implement a `counter` struct to keep track of bytes read and written along with the number of operations.
2. Create specialized structs (`readCounter`, `writeCounter`, and `readWriteCounter`) to wrap the standard I/O interfaces (io.Reader and io.Writer) and embed the counter functionality.
3. Provide methods for reading and writing that increment the respective counters, ensuring that all operations are thread-safe.

### Algorithm

1. **Counter Struct**: Define a struct to hold the byte and operation counts, using mutex locks to ensure safe concurrent access.
2. **Read and Write Counters**: Create structs that implement `io.Reader` and `io.Writer` interfaces, respectively, while tracking the number of bytes processed.
3. **ReadWrite Counter**: Combine both read and write counters into a single struct to handle both operations.
4. **Count Retrieval**: Provide methods to retrieve the current counts of bytes and operations.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package paasio

import (
	"io"
	"sync"
)

type counter struct {
	bytes uint64
	ops   uint32
	sync.Mutex
}

func (c *counter) increment(n int) {
	c.Lock()
	defer c.Unlock()
	c.bytes += uint64(n)
	c.ops++
}

func (c *counter) count() (int64, int) {
	c.Lock()
	defer c.Unlock()
	return int64(c.bytes), int(c.ops)
}

type readCounter struct {
	reader io.Reader
	counter
}

type writeCounter struct {
	writer io.Writer
	counter
}

type readWriteCounter struct {
	WriteCounter
	ReadCounter
}

func NewWriteCounter(writer io.Writer) WriteCounter {
	return &writeCounter{writer: writer}
}

func NewReadCounter(reader io.Reader) ReadCounter {
	return &readCounter{reader: reader}
}

func NewReadWriteCounter(readwriter io.ReadWriter) ReadWriteCounter {
	return &readWriteCounter{NewWriteCounter(readwriter), NewReadCounter(readwriter)}
}

func (rc *readCounter) Read(p []byte) (int, error) {
	n, err := rc.reader.Read(p)
	rc.increment(n)
	return n, err
}

func (rc *readCounter) ReadCount() (int64, int) {
	return rc.count()
}

func (wc *writeCounter) Write(p []byte) (int, error) {
	n, err := wc.writer.Write(p)
	wc.increment(n)
	return n, err
}

func (wc *writeCounter) WriteCount() (int64, int) {
	return wc.count()
}
```


### Explanation
    - The counter struct tracks the number of bytes and operations using sync.Mutex for thread safety.
    - The readCounter and writeCounter structs embed the counter and implement the io.Reader and io.Writer interfaces, respectively.
    - The NewReadCounter and NewWriteCounter functions create instances of their respective counters, while NewReadWriteCounter creates a combined counter for both read and write operations.
    - The Read and Write methods increment the corresponding counters after performing their respective operations, and the ReadCount and WriteCount methods retrieve the current counts.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: O(1) for read and write operations as the counting is performed in constant time.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the counters, with additional space for the byte slices being read or written.

## Conclusion
The PaaS I/O implementation in Go effectively tracks bytes read and written across streams while ensuring thread safety through the use of mutexes. This design allows for concurrent operations and provides useful insights into the I/O performance of applications.
