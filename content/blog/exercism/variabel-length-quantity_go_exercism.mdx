## Problem Statement

The Variable Length Quantity (VLQ) problem involves encoding and decoding integers using a variable-length encoding scheme. Each integer is represented in a way that allows for more efficient storage, especially for smaller values. The encoding format uses 7 bits for the value and the 8th bit as a continuation bit, indicating whether there are more bytes to follow. This scheme is commonly used in protocols and file formats to efficiently represent a series of integers.

## Approach

To solve the VLQ problem, we will:
1. **Encode Integers**: Implement a function that takes a slice of unsigned 32-bit integers and encodes them into a byte array using the VLQ format.
2. **Decode Bytes**: Create a function that decodes the byte array back into a slice of unsigned 32-bit integers, ensuring that it handles any potential errors in the encoding.
3. **Manage Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the input is empty or where the encoded sequence is incomplete.

### Algorithm

1. **Encoding Algorithm**:
   - Initialize an empty byte slice for the result.
   - For each integer:
     - Extract 7 bits at a time and store them in a byte.
     - Set the continuation bit for all but the last byte.
     - Append the resulting bytes to the result.

2. **Decoding Algorithm**:
   - Initialize an empty slice for the results and variables for the current integer.
   - Read through the input byte slice:
     - Extract the 7 bits and form the integer.
     - Check the continuation bit to determine if more bytes are available.
     - Append the complete integer to the results.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

import "errors"

// EncodeVarint encodes a slice of uint32 integers into a VLQ byte array.
func EncodeVarint(input []uint32) []byte {
	result := []byte{}
	for _, n := range input {
		tmp := []byte{}
		var b byte
		for i := 0; ; i++ {
			b = byte(n & 0b01111111)
			n = n >> 7
			if i > 0 {
				b = b | 0b10000000
			}
			tmp = append([]byte{b}, tmp...)
			if n == 0 {
				break
			}
		}
		result = append(result, tmp...)
	}
	return result
}

// DecodeVarint decodes a VLQ byte array into a slice of uint32 integers.
func DecodeVarint(input []byte) ([]uint32, error) {
	result := []uint32{}
	var n uint32
	i := uint32(0)
	for _, b := range input {
		if i > 0 {
			n = n << 7
		}
		n = n | uint32(b&0b01111111)
		i++
		if b&0b10000000 == 0 {
			result = append(result, n)
			i = 0
			n = 0
		}
	}
	if i != 0 {
		return result, errors.New("incomplete sequence")
	}
	return result, nil
}
```

### Explanation
    - **Encoding Process**: The EncodeVarint function processes each integer by repeatedly extracting 7 bits, setting the continuation bit for non-final bytes, and appending them to the result.
    - **Decoding Process**: The DecodeVarint function reconstructs the original integers from the byte array, checking for the continuation bit to determine when to complete an integer.
    - **Error Handling**: If there are leftover bits in the input that do not complete a valid integer, an error is returned.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity for both encoding and decoding is O(n), where n is the number of bytes processed. Each byte is handled a constant number of times.
    - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(m), where m is the number of encoded bytes, as the result byte slice can grow with the number of integers being processed.

## Conclusion
The Variable Length Quantity problem is efficiently solved in Go by implementing encoding and decoding functions that handle integer values with a space-efficient representation. By managing state and transitions effectively, we can ensure that our implementation is robust and handles edge cases appropriately.
