## Problem Statement

In the BOB problem, Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. He responds to conversation based on specific patterns in the input string. Bob answers based on the following rules:

- If you ask him a question (i.e., the remark ends with a question mark), he answers "Sure."
- If you yell at him (i.e., all letters in the remark are uppercase), he answers "Whoa, chill out!"
- If you yell a question at him, he answers "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"
- If you address him without saying anything (i.e., the remark is empty or consists only of whitespace), he responds with "Fine. Be that way!"
- For anything else, he responds with "Whatever."

## Approach

### Algorithm

1. **Trim whitespace**: Remove leading and trailing whitespace from the input string.
2. **Determine if it's silence**: Check if the string is empty after trimming.
3. **Check if the remark contains letters**: Determine if the remark includes any letters.
4. **Identify if it’s yelling**: Check if all letters in the remark are uppercase.
5. **Determine if it's a question**: Check if the remark ends with a question mark.
6. **Return the appropriate response**: Based on the conditions above, return one of Bob’s responses.

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go implementation for Bob's conversation logic:

```go
// Package bob provides a conversational agent that responds
// based on the tone of the remark.
package bob

import (
	"strings"
	"unicode"
)

// Hey responds based on the provided remark.
func Hey(remark string) string {
	trimmedRemark := strings.TrimSpace(remark)

	isSilence := trimmedRemark == ""
	hasLetters := strings.IndexFunc(trimmedRemark, unicode.IsLetter) >= 0
	isYelling := hasLetters && strings.ToUpper(trimmedRemark) == trimmedRemark
	isQuestion := strings.HasSuffix(trimmedRemark, "?")

	switch {
	case isSilence:
		return "Fine. Be that way!"
	case isYelling && isQuestion:
		return "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"
	case isYelling:
		return "Whoa, chill out!"
	case isQuestion:
		return "Sure."
	default:
		return "Whatever."
	}
}
```

### Explanation

	- **Trimming Whitespace**: The first step is to remove any leading or trailing whitespace using `strings.TrimSpace()`. This ensures we are working with the actual content of the remark.
	- **Detecting Silence**: Silence is defined as an empty string or one that contains only whitespace. After trimming, if the string is empty, Bob responds with "Fine. Be that way!".
	- **Checking for Letters**: The function `strings.IndexFunc()` is used to check if the remark contains any letters. This helps determine if Bob can identify yelling or normal speech.
	- **Detecting Yelling**: If the remark contains letters and all the letters are uppercase, Bob considers this yelling. We check this by comparing the remark with its uppercased version (`strings.ToUpper(remark)`).
	- **Detecting a Question**: If the remark ends with a question mark (`?`), it is considered a question. We use `strings.HasSuffix()` to check for this condition.
	- **Response Decision**: Based on these checks, the program decides which response Bob will give, prioritizing silence, yelling, or questions accordingly.

### Time and Space Complexity

	- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
		- Trimming whitespace with `strings.TrimSpace()` takes O(n) where n is the length of the remark.
		- Checking for letters and detecting yelling both involve scanning the entire remark, contributing O(n).
		- The final check for a question using `strings.HasSuffix()` is also O(n).
		- Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear in the size of the input remark.

	- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
		- We create a new string when trimming whitespace, which can be as large as the original remark (O(n)).
		- We don't use any additional data structures that scale with the input size, so the space complexity is linear in terms of the length of the input.

### Conclusion

The BOB problem can be efficiently solved using Go by analyzing the input string for specific patterns: silence, yelling, and questions. By using Go’s standard library functions such as `strings.TrimSpace()`, `strings.ToUpper()`, and `unicode.IsLetter()`, we can determine Bob's response with a time complexity of O(n). The approach is optimal, with both time and space complexities being linear, making it suitable for a wide range of input sizes.
