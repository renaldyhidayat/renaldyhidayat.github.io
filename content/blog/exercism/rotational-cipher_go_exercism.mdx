## Problem Statement

The Rotational Cipher problem involves encoding a given plaintext string using a rotational cipher technique. This method shifts each letter in the input string by a specified number of positions down the alphabet. The rotation is circular, meaning that after 'Z' comes 'A' for uppercase letters, and after 'z' comes 'a' for lowercase letters. Non-alphabetical characters remain unchanged in the output.

## Approach

### Algorithm

1. **Initialize an empty slice**: Prepare to store the resulting characters after applying the rotation.
2. **Iterate through each character**:
   - Check if the character is uppercase or lowercase.
   - Apply the shift for uppercase letters by calculating the new character using the formula `(current_character - 'A' + shiftKey) % 26`, then add 'A' back to get the final character.
   - Similarly, apply the shift for lowercase letters using `(current_character - 'a' + shiftKey) % 26`.
   - If the character is neither, simply append it unchanged to the result.
3. **Return the resulting string**: Convert the slice of characters back into a string.

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go implementation for the Rotational Cipher:

```go
package rotationalcipher

import "unicode"

// RotationalCipher encodes the plaintext string using a rotational cipher with a specified shift key.
func RotationalCipher(plain string, shiftKey int) string {
	var cipher []rune

	for _, a := range plain {
		if unicode.IsUpper(a) {
			a = rune('A' + (int(a-'A')+shiftKey)%26)
		} else if unicode.IsLower(a) {
			a = rune('a' + (int(a-'a')+shiftKey)%26)
		}

		cipher = append(cipher, a)
	}

	return string(cipher)
}
```


### Explanation
    - **Input Handling**: The function takes two parameters: the plain string to be encoded and the shiftKey, which determines how many positions each letter should be shifted.

    - #### **Character Processing**:

        - The function iterates over each character in the input string.
        - For uppercase letters, it calculates the new character by determining its position relative to 'A', applying the shift, and then wrapping around using modulo 26.
        - The same process is followed for lowercase letters, but using 'a' as the reference.
        - Non-alphabetical characters are appended to the result without any modifications.
        - Output Generation: Finally, the function returns the constructed string from the slice of runes.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - ### **Time Complexity**: O(n)

        - The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. Each character is processed exactly once.

    - ### **Space Complexity**: O(n)

        - The space complexity is O(n) as well, due to the storage required for the output slice of runes, which could potentially hold all characters from the input.

## Conclusion
The Rotational Cipher problem is efficiently solved using a straightforward algorithm that leverages basic character manipulation techniques. The implementation in Go is clean and concise, providing an effective way to encode strings with a rotational shift. With linear time complexity and linear space usage, this solution is optimal for handling varying input sizes while maintaining performance.
