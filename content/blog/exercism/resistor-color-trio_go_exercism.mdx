## Problem Statement

In electronics, resistors have colored bands that indicate their resistance values. The goal is to write a function that takes a list of three color names as input, which represent the first two digits and the power-of-ten multiplier, and returns the resistance value as a string formatted with appropriate units (ohms, kiloohms, megaohms, or gigaohms).

## Approach

We will use a map to assign integer values to color names. The first two colors represent the significant digits, and the third color is the power-of-ten multiplier. Based on the computed resistance value, we append the correct unit (ohms, kiloohms, megaohms, or gigaohms) and return it as a string.

### Algorithm

1. **Create a map**: Define a map where each color is mapped to its corresponding digit value.
2. **Calculate the resistance**: Using the first two colors for the significant digits and the third color as the multiplier, calculate the resistance value.
3. **Determine the unit**: Depending on the size of the resistance, append the appropriate unit:
   - 1 to 999 ohms: "ohms"
   - 1,000 to 999,999 ohms: "kiloohms"
   - 1,000,000 to 999,999,999 ohms: "megaohms"
   - 1,000,000,000 ohms and above: "gigaohms"
4. **Return the formatted result** as a string, e.g., "470 ohms" or "2 megaohms".

### Implementation in Go

```go
package resistorcolortrio

import (
	"math"
	"strconv"
)

func Label(colors []string) string {
	colorMap := map[string]int{
		"black":  0,
		"brown":  1,
		"red":    2,
		"orange": 3,
		"yellow": 4,
		"green":  5,
		"blue":   6,
		"violet": 7,
		"grey":   8,
		"white":  9,
	}

	resistorVal := (10*colorMap[colors[0]] + colorMap[colors[1]]) * int(math.Pow10(colorMap[colors[2]]))

	if resistorVal >= 1000000000 {
		return strconv.Itoa(resistorVal/1000000000) + " gigaohms"
	} else if resistorVal >= 1000000 {
		return strconv.Itoa(resistorVal/1000000) + " megaohms"
	} else if resistorVal >= 1000 {
		return strconv.Itoa(resistorVal/1000) + " kiloohms"
	} else {
		return strconv.Itoa(resistorVal) + " ohms"
	}
}
```

### Explanation
	- **Mapping Colors to Digits**: The colorMap maps each color to its corresponding digit value (e.g., black = 0, brown = 1, red = 2, etc.).
	- **Calculating the Resistance**: The formula (10*colorMap[colors[0]] + colorMap[colors[1]]) * int(math.Pow10(colorMap[colors[2]])) is used to calculate the resistance value based on the first two digits and the power-of-ten multiplier.
	- **Unit Determination**: The function then checks the magnitude of the calculated resistance value and appends the appropriate unit:
		If the value is ≥ 1,000,000,000, it appends "gigaohms".
		If the value is ≥ 1,000,000, it appends "megaohms".
		If the value is ≥ 1,000, it appends "kiloohms".
		Otherwise, it appends "ohms".

### Time and Space Complexity

	- **Time Complexity**: O(1), because the computation involves constant-time lookups from the map and simple arithmetic operations.
	- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we only store a fixed-size map and a few integers regardless of the input size.

## Conclusion
The Label function solves the resistor color trio problem by mapping resistor color codes to digit values and computing the resistance in the appropriate unit. It ensures an efficient and accurate solution with constant time and space complexity.
