## Problem Statement

The Word Count problem requires counting the frequency of each word in a given phrase. A word is defined as a sequence of characters that may include letters, digits, and apostrophes (for contractions). The task is to return a map where each key is a word and its corresponding value is the number of times that word appears in the phrase.

## Approach

### Algorithm

1. **Normalization**:
   - Convert the entire input phrase to lower case to ensure that the word count is case insensitive.

2. **Regular Expression**:
   - Use a regular expression to identify and extract words from the phrase. This regex will match sequences of word characters (letters, digits) and may include apostrophes for contractions.

3. **Counting Frequencies**:
   - Iterate over the extracted words and populate a frequency map, incrementing the count for each word encountered.

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go implementation of the Word Count functionality:

```go
// Package wordcount provides functionality to count the frequency of words in a phrase.
package wordcount

import (
	"regexp"
	"strings"
)

// Frequency is a map that holds the count of each word.
type Frequency map[string]int

// WordCount returns a map with the frequency of each word in the given phrase.
func WordCount(phrase string) Frequency {
	re := regexp.MustCompile(`\w+('\w+)?`) // Regular expression to match words
	count := make(Frequency)               // Initialize the frequency map
	for _, w := range re.FindAllString(strings.ToLower(phrase), -1) {
		count[w]++ // Increment the count for each word
	}
	return count // Return the frequency map
}
```

### Explanation
    - **WordCount Function**: This function takes a phrase as input and uses a regular expression to find all words. It normalizes the phrase by converting it to lower case. For each word found, it increments the corresponding count in the Frequency map.

    - **Regular Expression**: The regex \w+('\w+)? is used to match words. It matches a sequence of word characters and optionally allows for an apostrophe followed by more word characters, accommodating contractions like "it's".

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: O(n)

        - Where n is the length of the phrase. The function processes each character in the input string to extract words and count frequencies.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(m)

        - Where m is the number of unique words found. The space is required to store the frequency map of words.

## Conclusion
The Word Count problem is effectively addressed through a systematic approach in Go. By utilizing regular expressions and a frequency map, the solution accurately counts the occurrences of each word in a phrase. This implementation is efficient and straightforward, making it suitable for handling various input scenarios.
