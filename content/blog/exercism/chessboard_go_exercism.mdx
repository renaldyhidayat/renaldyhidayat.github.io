# Chessboard

In the **Chessboard** problem, we are tasked with managing the occupancy of squares on a chessboard. The solution involves creating a structure that allows us to count occupied squares in specific files and ranks, as well as to count all squares present on the board.

## Problem Statement

You need to implement a system that can:

1. Count how many squares are occupied in a given file (column).
2. Count how many squares are occupied in a specific rank (row).
3. Count all squares present on the chessboard.
4. Count how many squares are occupied across the entire chessboard.

## Approach

The approach consists of defining types to represent the chessboard and its files, followed by implementing functions to count occupied squares based on the specifications above.

### Algorithm

1. **File and Chessboard Types**:

   - Define a `File` type as a slice of booleans, where `true` indicates the square is occupied, and `false` indicates it is unoccupied.
   - Define a `Chessboard` type as a map from strings (representing files "A" to "H") to `File`.

2. **CountInFile**:

   - Implement a function to count the number of occupied squares in a specified file.

3. **CountInRank**:

   - Implement a function to count the number of occupied squares in a specified rank.

4. **CountAll**:

   - Implement a function to count all squares present on the chessboard.

5. **CountOccupied**:
   - Implement a function to count all occupied squares on the chessboard.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package chessboard

// Declare a type named File which stores if a square is occupied by a piece - this will be a slice of bools
type File []bool

// Declare a type named Chessboard which contains a map of eight Files, accessed with keys from "A" to "H"
type Chessboard map[string]File

// CountInFile returns how many squares are occupied in the chessboard,
// within the given file.
func CountInFile(cb Chessboard, file string) int {
	var c int
	for _, v := range cb[file] {
		if v {
			c++
		}
	}

	return c
}

// CountInRank returns how many squares are occupied in the chessboard,
// within the given rank.
func CountInRank(cb Chessboard, rank int) int {
	var c int

	if rank >= 1 && rank <= 8 {
		for _, v := range cb {
			if v[rank-1] {
				c++
			}
		}
	}

	return c
}

// CountAll should count how many squares are present in the chessboard.
func CountAll(cb Chessboard) int {
	var c int
	for _, v := range cb {
		for range v {
			c++
		}
	}

	return c
}

// CountOccupied returns how many squares are occupied in the chessboard.
func CountOccupied(cb Chessboard) int {
	var c int
	for _, v := range cb {
		for _, b := range v {
			if b {
				c++
			}
		}
	}

	return c
}
```


###Explanation

    1. **File and Chessboard Types**:

        The File type represents a column on the chessboard, using a slice of booleans to indicate whether each square is occupied.
        The Chessboard type uses a map to represent the eight files of the chessboard, with keys from "A" to "H" pointing to File.

    2. **CountInFile**:

        This function iterates over the specified file and counts how many squares are marked as occupied (true).

    3. **CountInRank**:

        This function iterates over all files in the chessboard, checking if the square in the specified rank is occupied, counting those that are.

    4. **CountAll**:

        This function counts all squares on the chessboard by iterating through each file and summing the number of squares in each file.

    5. **CountOccupied**:

        This function iterates over all files and counts how many squares are occupied across the entire chessboard.


### Time and Space Complexity
    - #### **Time Complexity**:

        - CountInFile, CountInRank, CountAll, and CountOccupied all operate in O(n) time, where n is the number of squares (64 for a standard chessboard). Each function iterates through the necessary structures to perform their counts.

    - #### **Space Complexity**:

        - The space complexity is O(1) for the counting functions, as they use a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the size of the input data.


## Conclusion
The Chessboard problem demonstrates how to effectively manage and query a chessboard's state using Go. By leveraging maps and slices, we can efficiently count occupied squares based on files and ranks, providing a clear and structured approach to chessboard management.
