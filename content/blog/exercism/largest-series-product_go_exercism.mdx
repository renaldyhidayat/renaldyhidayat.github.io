## Problem Statement

The Largest Series Product problem involves finding the maximum product of a contiguous subsequence of digits from a given string. The length of this subsequence is determined by a specified span. If the span is greater than the length of the string or if it is negative, an error should be returned. Additionally, if the string contains non-digit characters, an error should also be raised.

## Approach

### Algorithm

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Check if the provided span is valid (greater than zero and less than or equal to the length of the digit string). If not, return an error.
   - Convert the string of digits into a slice of bytes, validating that all characters are numeric.

2. **Calculate Maximum Product**:
   - Initialize a variable to hold the maximum product found.
   - Loop through the digit string, examining each contiguous subsequence of the specified span.
   - For each subsequence, calculate the product of its digits.
   - Update the maximum product if the current product exceeds it.

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go implementation of the Largest Series Product functionality:

```go
// Package lsproduct provides functionality to calculate the largest product of a series of digits.
package lsproduct

import "errors"

// LargestSeriesProduct returns the largest product of a contiguous subsequence of digits in a string.
func LargestSeriesProduct(digits string, span int) (int64, error) {
	if span > len(digits) || span < 0 {
		return 0, errors.New("incorrect span")
	}

	d := make([]byte, len(digits))

	for i, v := range digits {
		if v < '0' || v > '9' {
			return 0, errors.New("not a digit")
		}

		d[i] = byte(v - '0')
	}

	max := int64(0)

	for i := 0; i < len(d)-span+1; i++ {
		v := int64(1)

		for n := i; n < i+span; n++ {
			v = v * int64(d[n])
		}

		if v > max {
			max = v
		}
	}
	return max, nil
}
```

### Explanation

    - **LargestSeriesProduct Function**: This function calculates the largest product of a contiguous subsequence of digits. It first validates the span and converts the digits into an array of integers. It then iterates through the digits, calculating the product of each contiguous subsequence defined by the span, and keeps track of the maximum product encountered.

    - **Input Validation**: The function checks for negative spans and spans longer than the digit string. It also verifies that all characters in the string are digits.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - #### **Time Complexity**: O(n * m)

        - Where n is the length of the digit string and m is the span. The function processes each digit and calculates the product for each subsequence of the given span.
    - #### **Space Complexity**: O(n)

        - The space used is primarily for storing the digit array, which requires space proportional to the length of the input string.

## Conclusion
The Largest Series Product problem is solved efficiently through this implementation in Go. The approach involves careful input validation, followed by a straightforward calculation of products across the specified subsequences. This method ensures accuracy while maintaining efficiency, making it suitable for various input scenarios.
