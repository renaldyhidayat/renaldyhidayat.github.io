## Problem Statement

The **Wordy** problem involves interpreting a mathematical expression given in a string format. The input string begins with "What is" and includes a series of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on integers. The goal is to parse the input string and calculate the result of the expression while ensuring that the input format is valid.

## Approach

To solve the problem, we will perform the following steps:
1. Validate the input format using a regular expression.
2. Tokenize the input string to extract numbers and operators.
3. Evaluate the expression based on the extracted tokens, following the order of operations.

### Algorithm

1. Use a regular expression to check if the input string matches the expected format.
2. Tokenize the input string to separate numbers and operators.
3. Initialize the result with the first number.
4. Iterate through the tokens, applying the corresponding operation for each number based on the preceding operator.
5. Return the final result and a boolean indicating success.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package wordy

import (
	"regexp"
	"strconv"
)

// Answer calculates the result of the mathematical expression represented in the string.
func Answer(s string) (int, bool) {
	if match, _ := regexp.MatchString(`What is -?\d+(?: (?:plus|minus|divided by|multiplied by) -?\d+)*\?`, s); !match {
		return 0, false
	}
	tokens := regexp.MustCompile(`(plus|minus|divided|multiplied|-?\d+)`).FindAllString(s, -1)

	sum, _ := strconv.Atoi(tokens[0])

	for i := 2; i < len(tokens); i += 2 {
		n, _ := strconv.Atoi(tokens[i])

		switch tokens[i-1] {
		case "plus":
			sum += n
		case "minus":
			sum -= n
		case "divided":
			sum /= n
		case "multiplied":
			sum *= n
		}
	}

	return sum, true
}
```

## Explanation
    - **Function Signature**: The Answer function takes a string s as input and returns an integer result along with a boolean indicating whether the calculation was successful.
    - **Input Validation**: A regular expression checks whether the input matches the required format, ensuring it starts with "What is" and contains a valid sequence of operations.
    - **Tokenization**: The input string is split into tokens representing numbers and operations using a regular expression.

    - **Calculation**: The first number initializes the result, and a loop iterates over the tokens to apply each operation in sequence. The operations are executed based on the preceding operator.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of tokens in the input string. The algorithm processes each token once for validation and calculation.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the tokens extracted from the input string.

## Conclusion
The Wordy problem demonstrates how to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions in a natural language format. This solution efficiently handles input validation, tokenization, and computation, making it a solid example of string processing and arithmetic operations in Go.
