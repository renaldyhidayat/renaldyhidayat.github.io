## Problem Statement

The **OCR (Optical Character Recognition) Number** problem involves recognizing digits from a given text input, where each digit is represented as a 3x3 grid of ASCII characters. The challenge is to map these ASCII representations to the corresponding numeric digits from `0` to `9`, or return `"?"` for unrecognized patterns.

## Approach

The approach involves breaking down the input string into individual 3x3 segments, each representing a digit. For each 3x3 grid, we compare it to known digit patterns stored in a map. The final output is a string of recognized digits.

### Algorithm

1. **Digit Mapping**: A predefined map (`digitMap`) holds the 3x3 ASCII representation for each digit from `0` to `9`. If a digit cannot be recognized from the map, we return `"?"`.

2. **Input Processing**: The input string is split into lines, and then further into 3x3 grids, where each grid represents a single digit. The `recognizeDigit` function is used to identify the corresponding digit for each grid.

3. **Recognition**: For every 3x3 grid, we check it against our `digitMap`. If a match is found, the corresponding digit is appended to the result. If no match is found, `"?"` is appended instead.

4. **Returning Output**: The recognized digits for each line are combined and returned as a slice of strings.

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go implementation for solving the **OCR Number** problem:

```go
package ocr

import "strings"

var digitMap = map[[3]string]string{
	{" _ ", "| |", "|_|"}: "0",
	{"   ", "  |", "  |"}: "1",
	{" _ ", " _|", "|_ "}: "2",
	{" _ ", " _|", " _|"}: "3",
	{"   ", "|_|", "  |"}: "4",
	{" _ ", "|_ ", " _|"}: "5",
	{" _ ", "|_ ", "|_|"}: "6",
	{" _ ", "  |", "  |"}: "7",
	{" _ ", "|_|", "|_|"}: "8",
	{" _ ", "|_|", " _|"}: "9"}

func recognizeDigit(digitIn [3]string) string {
	digitOut, ok := digitMap[digitIn]
	if !ok {
		return "?"
	}
	return digitOut
}

func Recognize(input string) (output []string) {
	for rows := strings.Split(input[1:], "\n"); len(rows) >= 4; rows = rows[4:] {
		var entry string
		for len(rows[0]) >= 3 {
			var ocr [3]string
			for i := range ocr {
				ocr[i] = rows[i][:3]
				rows[i] = rows[i][3:]
			}
			entry += recognizeDigit(ocr)
		}
		output = append(output, entry)
	}
	return output
}
```

### Explanation
    - **Main Function Recognize**:

       -  This function processes the input text by splitting it into rows and then extracting 3x3 blocks of ASCII characters representing digits. Each block is passed to the recognizeDigit function for recognition.
       - The result for each line of digits is stored in the output slice.
    
    - **Helper Function recognizeDigit**:

        - This function takes a 3x3 block of ASCII characters and compares it to the predefined digit map (digitMap). If a match is found, it returns the corresponding digit as a string. If not, it returns "?".
    
    - **Digit Mapping**:

        - The digitMap defines the 3x3 grid patterns for each digit (0 to 9). Each digit is represented as three lines of text (strings).

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**:

        - The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of characters in the input string. The function processes each 3x3 block of characters once.
    
    - **Space Complexity**:

        - The space complexity is O(n) due to the need to store the input rows and the resulting output. Additional space is used by the map (digitMap), but this is constant and does not depend on the input size.

## Conclusion
The OCR Number problem can be efficiently solved by using a map to store the 3x3 ASCII representations of digits and comparing input blocks against this map. This approach is simple, efficient, and handles all possible inputs within the problem constraints.
