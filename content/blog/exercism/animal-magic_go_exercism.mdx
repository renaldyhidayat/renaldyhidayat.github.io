# Animal Magic

In this article, we will solve the **Animal Magic** problem, where we simulate rolling a die, generating random wand energy, and shuffling a list of animals. All of these tasks involve using randomness, which we can handle efficiently using Goâ€™s built-in `math/rand` package.

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with simulating random events in a magical world:
1. **Roll a Die**: Return a random integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
2. **Generate Wand Energy**: Return a random floating-point number between 0.0 and less than 12.0.
3. **Shuffle Animals**: Randomly shuffle a list of eight animals and return them in the new order.

## Approach

The core of this solution revolves around generating random numbers and manipulating slices. We'll use `rand.Seed` to ensure that our random values are different on each run and the `rand` package functions to generate the required random values.

### Algorithm

1. **Roll a Die**:
   - Generate a random number between 1 and 20 by calling `rand.Intn(20)` and adding 1 to it.
   
2. **Generate Wand Energy**:
   - Generate a random floating-point number between 0.0 and 12.0 by calling `rand.Float64()` (which generates a value between 0.0 and 1.0) and multiplying it by 12.

3. **Shuffle Animals**:
   - Use a predefined slice of eight animals and apply `rand.Shuffle` to rearrange the elements in a random order.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package chance

import (
    "math/rand"
    "time"
)

// RollADie returns a random int d with 1 <= d <= 20.
func RollADie() int {
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano()) // Seeding with current time for randomness
    return rand.Intn(20) + 1
}

// GenerateWandEnergy returns a random float64 f with 0.0 <= f < 12.0.
func GenerateWandEnergy() float64 {
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano()) // Re-seeding for randomness
    return rand.Float64() * 12.0
}

// ShuffleAnimals returns a slice with all eight animal strings in random order.
func ShuffleAnimals() []string {
    animals := []string{"ant", "beaver", "cat", "dog", "elephant", "fox", "giraffe", "hedgehog"}
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano()) // Seeding to ensure shuffle randomness
    rand.Shuffle(len(animals), func(i, j int) {
        animals[i], animals[j] = animals[j], animals[i]
    })
    return animals
}
```

### Explanation
1. **RollADie**:

    - We use rand.Intn(20) to generate a number between 0 and 19, then add 1 to get a number between 1 and 20.
    - rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano()) is called to ensure that the random values change on every run by seeding the generator with the current time in nanoseconds.

2. **GenerateWandEnergy**:

    - We use rand.Float64() to generate a floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0, then multiply it by 12.0 to scale it between 0.0 and less than 12.0.
    - rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano()) is called here as well to ensure randomness.

3. **ShuffleAnimals**:

    - We use rand.Shuffle to shuffle the animal slice. This function randomly swaps elements in the slice to achieve a new random order. We again seed the random number generator for reliable randomness on every execution.


### Time and Space Complexity

    - #### **Time Complexity**:

        - **RollADie**: O(1) as we are generating a single random number.
        - **GenerateWandEnergy**: O(1) because it involves generating a single random floating-point number.
        - **ShuffleAnimals**: O(n), where n is the number of animals in the list. The rand.Shuffle function iterates over the list once to shuffle it.

    - #### **Space Complexity**:

        - All functions have a space complexity of O(1) since we are only working with a fixed number of variables and modifying the slice in-place.


## Conclusion

We successfully implemented the Animal Magic problem by simulating randomness in Go. We utilized the math/rand package to generate random numbers and shuffle a list of animals. Using rand.Seed ensures that each run of the program generates a new set of results, giving a realistic simulation of magical randomness.
