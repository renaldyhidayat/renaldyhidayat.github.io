# Weather Forecast

In this article, we will solve the **Weather Forecast** problem using Go. This problem involves creating a simple weather forecasting system that stores and returns information about the weather conditions in a specified city. Let's walk through the solution.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to create a small package in Go that:

1. **Stores the current weather condition** for a given city.
2. **Forecasts the weather** by accepting the city and its weather condition and returns a formatted string.
3. Updates the current location and weather condition every time a new forecast is provided.

## Approach

We'll define two variables:
- `CurrentLocation`: to store the city for which the weather forecast is being made.
- `CurrentCondition`: to store the current weather condition for the city.

Then, we implement a `Forecast` function that takes two arguments, the `city` and the `condition`, updates the variables, and returns a formatted string with the forecast.

### Algorithm

1. **Store the current location**: When a forecast is requested, update the `CurrentLocation` to the provided city.
2. **Store the current condition**: Update the `CurrentCondition` to the provided weather condition.
3. **Return the formatted forecast**: Concatenate the city and condition into a meaningful string and return it.

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go code implementation for the Weather Forecast problem:

```go
// Package weather provides functions and variables for forecasting weather conditions in various cities of Goblinocus.
// It includes the ability to store and retrieve information about the current weather condition and location.
package weather

// CurrentCondition stores the current weather condition of a city.
var CurrentCondition string

// CurrentLocation stores the current location for which weather information is being forecasted.
var CurrentLocation string

// Forecast returns a string representing the forecasted weather condition for a given city.
// It updates the CurrentLocation and CurrentCondition variables with the provided city and weather condition,
// and then returns a string containing the location and its current weather condition.
func Forecast(city, condition string) string {
    CurrentLocation, CurrentCondition = city, condition
    return CurrentLocation + " - current weather condition: " + CurrentCondition
}

```

### Explanation

- **CurrentCondition**: This variable stores the weather condition of the currently forecasted city.
- **CurrentLocation**: This variable stores the city for which the weather condition is forecasted.
- **Forecast Function**: The Forecast function updates the CurrentLocation and CurrentCondition based on the provided arguments and returns a formatted string in the format "City - current weather condition: Condition".


### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the Forecast function is O(1). Updating the variables and returning the formatted string both take constant time.

    - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) as well, since we are only storing two strings (the city and the weather condition), and no additional data structures are required.

## Conclusion
The **Weather Forecast** problem demonstrates a simple yet effective way to track weather conditions for different cities. By utilizing Go's global variables, we are able to store and update the current weather data efficiently.
