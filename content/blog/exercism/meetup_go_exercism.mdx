## Problem Statement

The **Meetup** problem requires determining the date of a specific occurrence of a weekday (e.g., first, second, third, last, etc.) within a given month and year. The goal is to calculate the correct date based on specified input parameters, including the weekday of interest and the occurrence pattern.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we will:
1. Define constants representing each occurrence of the weekday.
2. Use the `time` package in Go to handle date calculations.
3. Create a function that calculates the correct date based on the occurrence specified.

### Algorithm

1. **Define Constants**: Set up constants for the occurrences of the weekday: First, Second, Third, Fourth, Teenth, and Last.
2. **Calculate the Date**:
   - If the occurrence is Last, increment the month to facilitate calculation.
   - Create a `time.Date` object with the specified year and month.
   - Calculate the day by finding the difference between the target weekday and the current weekday, adjusting for wrapping around the week.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package meetup

import "time"

type WeekSchedule int

const (
	First  = 1
	Second = 8
	Third  = 15
	Fourth = 22
	Teenth = 13
	Last   = -6
)

func Day(wSched WeekSchedule, wDay time.Weekday, month time.Month, year int) int {
	if wSched == Last {
		month++
	}

	t := time.Date(year, month, int(wSched), 12, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC)

	return t.Day() + int(wDay-t.Weekday()+7)%7
}
```

### Explanation
    - **WeekSchedule Type**: A custom integer type to represent the different occurrences of weekdays.
    Constants: Each constant (First, Second, Third, Fourth, Teenth, Last) corresponds to a specific day or set of days in the month.
    - **Day Function**: This function calculates the exact date based on the input parameters:
    If the schedule is Last, the function adjusts the month to simplify finding the last occurrence.
    The function creates a date and calculates the target day by adjusting for the difference in weekdays.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: O(1) since the calculations are straightforward and do not depend on input size.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(1) as no additional space is used that scales with input.

## Conclusion
The Meetup problem highlights the power of the Go time package for date manipulation and the ease of implementing business logic to find specific weekdays. This approach provides an efficient solution to determine meeting dates based on various criteria.
