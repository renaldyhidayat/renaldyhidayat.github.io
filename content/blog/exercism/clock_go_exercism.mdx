## Problem Statement

The Clock problem requires creating a simple clock representation that can manage time calculations, such as adding or subtracting minutes from a given time. The clock should handle 24-hour time format, where times wrap around after 24 hours. The goal is to implement a Clock type that allows for the creation of a new clock time, as well as methods to add or subtract minutes, and to represent the time as a string.

## Approach

### Algorithm

1. **Clock Structure**: Define a `Clock` struct that holds the total minutes since midnight.
2. **Constructor Function**: Implement a `New` function to initialize the clock by converting hours and minutes into total minutes, ensuring it wraps correctly within a 24-hour period.
3. **Add and Subtract Methods**: Create methods to add or subtract minutes from the clock, recalculating the time as necessary.
4. **String Representation**: Implement a method to convert the clock time to a string format (`HH:MM`).

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go implementation of the Clock:

```go
package clock

import (
	"fmt"
)

// Define the Clock type here.
type Clock struct {
	m int
}

// New creates a new Clock instance based on the given hours and minutes.
func New(h, m int) Clock {
	minutes := h*60 + m
	minutes %= 24 * 60

	if minutes < 0 {
		minutes += 24 * 60
	}

	return Clock{m: minutes}
}

// Add adds the specified number of minutes to the Clock.
func (c Clock) Add(m int) Clock {
	c = New(c.hours(), c.minutes()+m)
	return c
}

// Subtract subtracts the specified number of minutes from the Clock.
func (c Clock) Subtract(m int) Clock {
	c = New(c.hours(), c.minutes()-m)
	return c
}

// String returns the time in HH:MM format.
func (c Clock) String() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("%02d:%02d", c.hours(), c.minutes())
}

// hours returns the hour part of the time.
func (c Clock) hours() int {
	return (c.m / 60) % 24
}

// minutes returns the minute part of the time.
func (c Clock) minutes() int {
	return c.m % 60
}
```

### Explanation

    - **Clock Struct**: The Clock struct holds an integer m, which represents the total number of minutes since midnight.

    - **New Function**: The New function computes the total minutes from the provided hours and minutes. It uses the modulus operator to ensure that the result stays within a 24-hour period and adjusts negative values to wrap around correctly.

    - **Add and Subtract Methods**: The Add and Subtract methods adjust the current clock time by adding or subtracting a specified number of minutes. Each method recalculates the clock time using the New function.

    - **String Representation**: The String method formats the hours and minutes into a string that adheres to the HH:MM format, ensuring two digits for both.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - #### Time Complexity: O(1)

        - The operations for adding, subtracting, and creating a new clock time all take constant time since they involve basic arithmetic and modulus operations.
    - #### Space Complexity: O(1)

        - The space complexity is also O(1), as the implementation uses a fixed amount of space for the Clock struct regardless of the input values.
## Conclusion
The Clock problem is effectively solved with a simple yet powerful implementation in Go. By utilizing a straightforward structure to represent time and methods for time manipulation, this solution provides a clear approach to managing time calculations in a 24-hour format. The implementation is efficient, with constant time and space complexity, making it suitable for various applications requiring time management.
