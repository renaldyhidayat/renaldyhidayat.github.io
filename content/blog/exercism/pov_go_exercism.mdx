## Problem Statement

The **POV** (Point of View) problem involves manipulating a tree data structure by changing the root to a specified node, making that node the new root and adjusting the tree accordingly. Additionally, it also requires finding the path between two nodes in the tree.

In this problem, you are given a tree, and you need to:
1. Reorient the tree so that a given node becomes the new root.
2. Find the path from one node to another after the reorientation.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts:
1. **Reorienting the tree**: Given a target node, we traverse the tree to find it and then restructure the tree so that this node becomes the root.
2. **Finding the path between two nodes**: After reorienting the tree, finding the path from one node to another is straightforward by traversing the tree starting from the new root.

### Algorithm

#### 1. Reorienting the Tree
The function `FromPov` starts by finding the path from the current root to the target node. Once the path is found, the tree is restructured by reversing the direction of parent-child relationships along the path.

#### 2. Finding the Path
Once the tree is reoriented, we can find the path from one node to another by traversing the tree starting from the new root. The function `PathTo` handles this by reorienting the tree first and then tracing the path.

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go implementation for solving the **POV** problem:

```go
package pov

type Tree struct {
	value string
	children  []*Tree
}

func New(value string, children ...*Tree) *Tree {
    return &Tree{value, children}
}

func (t *Tree) Value() string {
    return t.value
}

func (t *Tree) Children() []*Tree {
    return t.children
}

func (t *Tree) tracePath(target string, trace []*Tree) []*Tree {
	trace = append(trace, t)

    if t.value == target { return trace }

	for _, kid := range t.children {
		result := kid.tracePath(target, trace)

        if result != nil { return result }
	}

    return nil
}

func (t *Tree) FromPov(targetValue string) *Tree {
	trace := t.tracePath(targetValue, make([]*Tree, 0, 4))

	if len(trace) == 0 { return nil }

	for i := len(trace) - 1; i > 0; i-- {
		curr, parent := trace[i], trace[i-1]

		for j, kid := range parent.children {
			if kid == curr {
				parent.children = append(parent.children[:j], parent.children[j + 1:]...)

                break
			}
		}

        curr.children = append(curr.children, parent)
	}

    return trace[len(trace) - 1]
}

func (t *Tree) PathTo(from, to string) []string {
	fromTree := t.FromPov(from)

	if fromTree == nil { return nil }

	trace := fromTree.tracePath(to, make([]*Tree, 0, 4))
	result := make([]string, 0, len(trace))

	for _, tree := range trace {
		result = append(result, tree.value)
	}

	return result
}
```


### Explanation
    - **Tree Structure**: The Tree struct represents a node in the tree, which holds a value and its children.

    - **Reorienting the Tree**:

        - FromPov first calls tracePath to find the path from the root to the target node.
        After finding the path, it reverses the parent-child relationship along the path to make the target node the new root.
    
    - **Finding Path**:

        - PathTo uses FromPov to reorient the tree to make the from node the new root.
        - After reorienting, it calls tracePath again to trace the path from the new root (from) to the target node (to).

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**:
        - Both FromPov and PathTo traverse the tree, making the time complexity for both O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because in the worst case, we visit every node in the tree once during the traversal.
    
    - **Space Complexity**:
        - The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is due to the space required for the recursion stack when traversing the tree.

## Conclusion
The POV problem involves manipulating a tree data structure to change the point of view and finding paths between nodes. By recursively tracing paths and reorienting parent-child relationships, we can efficiently solve the problem. This Go implementation provides a clear and efficient solution to handle the problem with linear time complexity relative to the size of the tree.
