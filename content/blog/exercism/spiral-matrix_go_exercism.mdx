## Problem Statement

The **Spiral Matrix** problem involves generating a square matrix of size `n x n` filled with integers from 1 to `n^2` in a spiral order. The task is to fill the matrix starting from the top-left corner, moving to the right, and then continuing in a spiral pattern until the entire matrix is filled.

## Approach

### Algorithm

1. **Matrix Initialization**: Start by creating a square matrix of size `n x n` initialized with zeroes.
  
2. **Direction Control**: Use direction vectors to control the movement within the matrix:
   - Start moving to the right (`dr = 0, dc = 1`).
   - Change direction when encountering a boundary or a previously filled cell.

3. **Filling the Matrix**: Iterate from 1 to `n^2`, placing each number in the current position of the matrix and updating the position according to the current direction.

4. **Boundary Check**: Before moving to the next cell, check if the new position is out of bounds or already filled. If so, change the direction (rotate clockwise).

### Implementation in Go

```go
package spiralmatrix

func SpiralMatrix(n int) [][]int {
    if n <= 0 {
        return [][]int{}
    }

    matrix := make([][]int, n)

    for i := range matrix {
        matrix[i] = make([]int, n)
    }

    r, c := 0, 0
    dr, dc := 0, 1

    for i := 1; i <= n*n; i++ {
        matrix[r][c] = i

        if r+dr < 0 || r+dr >= n || c+dc < 0 || c+dc >= n || matrix[r+dr][c+dc] != 0 {
            dr, dc = dc, -dr
        }
        r, c = r+dr, c+dc
    }

    return matrix
}
```

### Explanation
    - **Matrix Creation**: The matrix is created as a slice of slices in Go, initialized to hold integers.

    - **Direction Control**:

        - The direction is controlled using two variables, dr and dc, which represent the change in row and column indices, respectively.
        The movement starts by going right (increasing the column index).
    - **Filling Logic**:

        - Each number from 1 to n^2 is placed in the matrix at position (r, c).
        The next position is calculated based on the current direction. If the next position goes out of bounds or lands on a filled cell, the direction is changed (rotated).

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) because we fill n^2 cells in the matrix, with each cell being accessed once.

    - **Space Complexity**: O(n^2) due to the storage of the n x n matrix in memory.

## Conclusion
The Spiral Matrix problem illustrates a systematic approach to traversing a two-dimensional space in a defined pattern. The implementation effectively manages direction changes and boundary checks, allowing for a clean and efficient solution to generate the desired spiral arrangement.
