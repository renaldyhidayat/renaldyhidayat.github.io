## Problem Statement

The Minesweeper problem involves creating an annotated board that indicates the number of mines surrounding each cell in a grid. The grid is represented as a slice of strings, where each cell can either be empty (' ') or contain a mine ('*'). The objective is to return a new board with numbers representing the count of mines in the surrounding eight cells for each empty cell, while keeping mine cells unchanged.

## Approach

The approach consists of iterating through each cell in the board and checking its neighboring cells to count the number of mines. 

### Algorithm

1. Initialize a function `minesAt` to count the number of mines surrounding a given cell.
2. In the `Annotate` function:
   - Iterate through each cell in the board.
   - If the cell is empty (' '), use `minesAt` to get the count of surrounding mines.
   - Replace the empty cell with the corresponding number if there are any mines; otherwise, leave it as is.
3. Construct a new annotated board with the modified values.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package minesweeper

// Annotate returns an annotated board
func minesAt(board []string, row, col int) int {
	mines := 0

	nrows := len(board)
	ncols := len(board[0])

	border := row + 1

	if border >= nrows {
		border = -1
	}

	rows := [8]int{
		row - 1,
		row - 1,
		row - 1,
		row,
		row,
		border,
		border,
		border,
	}

	border = col + 1

	if border >= ncols {
		border = -1
	}

	cols := [8]int{
		col - 1,
		col,
		border,
		col - 1,
		border,
		col - 1,
		col,
		border,
	}

	for i := 0; i < 8; i++ {
		r, c := rows[i], cols[i]

		if r >= 0 && c >= 0 && board[r][c] == '*' {
			mines++
		}
	}

	return mines
}

func Annotate(board []string) []string {
	nrows := len(board)

	if nrows == 0 {
		return []string{}
	}

	ncols := len(board[0])

	annotation := make([]string, 0, nrows)

	for r := 0; r < nrows; r++ {
		bb := []byte(board[r])

		for c := 0; c < ncols; c++ {
			if bb[c] == ' ' {
				mines := minesAt(board, r, c)

				if mines > 0 {
					bb[c] = '0' + byte(mines)
				}
			}
		}

		annotation = append(annotation, string(bb))
	}

	return annotation
}
```

### Explanation
    - The minesAt function calculates the number of mines surrounding a specific cell by checking all eight possible neighboring cells. It handles the edges of the board to avoid out-of-bound errors.
    - The Annotate function constructs a new annotated board by iterating through each cell, replacing empty cells with the count of surrounding mines if applicable.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. Each cell is processed once, and checking its neighbors takes constant time.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(n * m) for the output board that holds the annotations.

### Conclusion
The Minesweeper solution effectively processes the input board to provide an annotated output that enhances gameplay by indicating the proximity of mines. The implemented solution in Go demonstrates a clear understanding of grid manipulation and neighbor checking, providing an efficient and effective approach to the problem.
