## Problem Statement

An **Armstrong number** (or Narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because:

```plaintext
153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153
```

The goal is to determine whether a given integer is an Armstrong number.

## Approach

### Algorithm

1. Convert the given number `n` into a string to easily access each digit.
2. Determine the number of digits in the number.
3. For each digit, compute the value of the digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. Sum all the computed values.
5. If the sum is equal to the original number, it is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it is not.

### Implementation in Go

Hereâ€™s the implementation in Go to check if a given number is an Armstrong number:

```go
package armstrong

import (
	"math"
	"strconv"
)

// IsNumber determines if the given number is an Armstrong number.
func IsNumber(n int) bool {
	strNum := strconv.Itoa(n)
	numDigit := len(strNum)
	sum := 0

	for _, digitChar := range strNum {
		digit, _ := strconv.Atoi(string(digitChar))
		sum += int(math.Pow(float64(digit), float64(numDigit)))
	}

	return sum == n
}
```

### Explanation
    - **Converting to String**: The number n is converted to a string using strconv.Itoa to allow easy access to each digit.
    - **Counting Digits**: The length of the string representation gives the number of digits.
    - **Sum of Powers**: For each digit, we calculate its power raised to the number of digits (digit^numDigits) using math.Pow. The sum of all these powers is accumulated.
    - **Comparison**: If the sum matches the original number, the function returns true, indicating that the number is an Armstrong number.

### **Time and Space Complexity**
    - #### **Time Complexity**: O(d), where d is the number of digits in the number n. The function iterates through each digit, performing constant-time operations.

    - #### **Space Complexity**: O(d), as the function stores the string representation of the number and calculates values for each digit.

## Conclusion
This approach efficiently checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number by calculating the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits. The solution uses basic mathematical operations and string manipulation, making it straightforward and efficient in terms of time and space.
