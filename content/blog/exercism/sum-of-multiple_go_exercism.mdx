## Problem Statement

The **Sum Of Multiples** problem requires calculating the sum of all unique multiples of given divisors below a specified limit. The solution should efficiently handle multiple divisors and avoid counting any multiple more than once. The challenge includes dealing with edge cases, such as divisors of zero.

## Approach

To solve the problem, we will maintain a set of unique multiples of the given divisors up to the limit. We will iterate through each divisor and generate multiples, summing them as we go.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize a map to keep track of unique multiples.
2. For each divisor:
   - If the divisor is zero, skip it.
   - Generate multiples of the divisor that are less than the limit.
   - Add each multiple to the map (to ensure uniqueness) and update the sum.
3. Return the final sum of unique multiples.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package summultiples

// SumMultiples calculates the sum of unique multiples of the given divisors below the specified limit.
func SumMultiples(limit int, divisors ...int) int {
	list := map[int]bool{}
	sum := 0

	for _, i := range divisors {
		if i == 0 {
			continue
		}

		for j := i; j < limit; j += i {
			if _, ok := list[j]; !ok {
				list[j] = true
				sum += j
			}
		}
	}
	return sum
}
```

### Explanation
    - **Function Signature**: The SumMultiples function takes an integer limit and a variadic number of integers divisors.
    - **Map for Uniqueness**: A map (list) is used to track which multiples have already been included in the sum. This prevents duplicate additions.
    - **Looping through Divisors**: For each divisor:
        - If the divisor is zero, it is skipped since multiples of zero are not defined.
        - The inner loop generates multiples of the divisor starting from the divisor itself up to the limit. Each multiple is checked against the map for uniqueness.
        - If the multiple is not already in the map, it is added and included in the sum.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the sum of the multiples found. The algorithm iterates over the range defined by the divisors and checks each multiple, making it efficient.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of unique multiples stored in the map. This space is needed to ensure that we do not count duplicates.

## Conclusion
The Sum Of Multiples solution efficiently computes the sum of all unique multiples of specified divisors below a given limit. By using a map to track unique values, the implementation is both straightforward and performant. This approach can be easily extended or modified to accommodate more complex requirements as needed.
