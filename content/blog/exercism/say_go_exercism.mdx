## Problem Statement

The **Say** problem involves converting a given integer number (within a specified range) into its English word representation. The function needs to handle numbers from `0` to just below a trillion (i.e., `0` to `999,999,999,999`). The challenge lies in efficiently breaking down the number and constructing its corresponding word form, including handling the correct use of "hundred," "thousand," "million," and "billion."

## Approach

The approach involves breaking down the number into segments and recursively converting each segment into its word representation using helper functions. The solution breaks down the number by powers of ten, such as hundreds, thousands, millions, and billions.

### Algorithm

1. **Base Case (Small Numbers)**: For numbers less than 100, we directly map the number to its word form using the `small` function. This function handles cases like "thirteen" or "twenty-one."
   
2. **Compound Numbers**: For larger numbers (i.e., hundreds, thousands, millions, billions), we divide the number using the appropriate base (e.g., 100 for "hundred," 1,000 for "thousand"). We then recursively build the word representation by combining the results for the quotient and the remainder.

3. **Recursion**: The function calls itself recursively to handle both the quotient and remainder for compound numbers. For example, to say "1,234," the function first says "one thousand," and then recursively processes "234" to return "two hundred thirty-four."

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go implementation for solving the **Say** problem:

```go
package say

func Say(n int64) (string, bool) {
	switch {
	case n < 0 || n >= 1_000_000_000_000:
		return "", false
	case n < 100:
		return small(n), true
	case n < 1_000:
		return compound(n, 100, "hundred"), true
	case n < 1_000_000:
		return compound(n, 1_000, "thousand"), true
	case n < 1_000_000_000:
		return compound(n, 1_000_000, "million"), true
	default:
		return compound(n, 1_000_000_000, "billion"), true
	}
}

func divmod(n int64, divisor int64) (int64, int64) {
	return (n / divisor), (n % divisor)
}

func compound(n int64, base int64, unit string) string {
	quo, rem := divmod(n, base)
	result, _ := Say(quo)
	result += " " + unit
	if rem != 0 {
		rest, _ := Say(rem)
		result += " " + rest
	}
	return result
}

func small(n int64) string {
	switch {
	case n ==  0: return "zero"
	case n ==  1: return "one"
	case n ==  2: return "two"
	case n ==  3: return "three"
	case n ==  4: return "four"
	case n ==  5: return "five"
	case n ==  6: return "six"
	case n ==  7: return "seven"
	case n ==  8: return "eight"
	case n ==  9: return "nine"
	case n == 10: return "ten"
	case n == 11: return "eleven"
	case n == 12: return "twelve"
	case n == 13: return "thirteen"
	case n == 14: return "fourteen"
	case n == 15: return "fifteen"
	case n == 16: return "sixteen"
	case n == 17: return "seventeen"
	case n == 18: return "eighteen"
	case n == 19: return "nineteen"
	case n == 20: return "twenty"
	case n == 30: return "thirty"
	case n == 40: return "forty"
	case n == 50: return "fifty"
	case n == 60: return "sixty"
	case n == 70: return "seventy"
	case n == 80: return "eighty"
	case n == 90: return "ninety"
	case n <= 99:
		tens, ones := divmod(n, 10)
		return small(tens * 10) + "-" + small(ones)
    default:
        panic("value too big for small(n)")
	}
}
```


### Explanation
    - **Main Function Say**:

        - It determines the size of the number and delegates work to appropriate helper functions.
        - Numbers less than 100 are directly handled by the small function.
        - For larger numbers (hundreds, thousands, millions, and billions), the function calls compound to recursively build the word representation.
    
    - **Helper Functions**:

        - **small**: Handles numbers below 100, including direct mappings for numbers like "thirteen" and "ninety."
        - **compound**: Breaks down larger numbers using division (e.g., 1,234 becomes 1 thousand and 234). It recursively processes the remainder and appends the appropriate unit (e.g., "thousand," "million").
        - **divmod**: A utility function to divide a number and get both the quotient and remainder.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**:

        The time complexity is O(log n), where n is the input number. This is because each recursive call reduces the size of the number by dividing it by 10, which effectively results in logarithmic time complexity with respect to the number of digits.
    
    - **Space Complexity**:

        The space complexity is O(log n) due to the recursion depth, which is proportional to the number of digits in the number.

## Conclusion
The Say problem can be efficiently solved using recursion to break down large numbers into smaller components and converting each part into its word representation. The approach handles numbers up to just below a trillion, providing a scalable solution for converting numbers into English words in Go.
