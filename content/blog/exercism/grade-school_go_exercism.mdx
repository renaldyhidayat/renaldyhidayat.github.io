## Problem Statement

The Grade School problem requires creating a school management system that can keep track of students' names associated with their respective grades. The system should allow adding students to specific grades, retrieving students for a given grade, and listing all grades along with their students in a sorted manner.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we will:
1. **Define Types**: Create `Grade` and `School` types to represent the structure of the data.
2. **Add Students**: Implement a method to add students to their respective grades.
3. **Retrieve Grades**: Provide functionality to retrieve students by grade.
4. **Enrollment Listing**: Implement a method to list all grades along with the corresponding students sorted alphabetically.

### Algorithm

1. **Data Structures**:
   - `Grade`: A struct that contains the grade level and a slice of student names.
   - `School`: A map where keys are grade levels and values are slices of student names.

2. **Functionality**:
   - `New()`: Initializes a new school.
   - `Add(student, grade)`: Adds a student to the specified grade.
   - `Grade(level)`: Retrieves a list of students in the specified grade.
   - `Enrollment()`: Returns a sorted list of all grades and their respective students.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package school

import "sort"

// Define the Grade and School types here.

type Grade struct {
	level    int
	students []string
}

type School map[int][]string

func New() *School {
	return &School{}
}

func (s School) Add(student string, grade int) {
	s[grade] = append(s[grade], student)
}

func (s School) Grade(level int) []string {
	return s[level]
}

func (s School) Enrollment() []Grade {
	var rooster []Grade

	for level, student := range s {
		sort.Strings(student)

		rooster = append(rooster, Grade{level, student})
	}

	sort.Slice(rooster, func(i, j int) bool {
		return rooster[i].level < rooster[j].level
	})

	return rooster
}
```

### Explanation
    - **Data Structure**: The Grade struct holds the grade level and the list of students in that grade. The School type is a map where each key represents a grade and its associated value is a slice of students in that grade.
    - **Adding Students**: The Add method appends a student to the slice corresponding to their grade in the School map.
    - **Retrieving Grades**: The Grade method returns the list of students for the specified grade, allowing easy access to student data.
    - **Enrollment Listing**: The Enrollment method sorts the student lists alphabetically and also sorts the grades in ascending order before returning the complete list.

### Time and Space Complexity
    
    - **Time Complexity**:
        - Adding a student takes O(1) time for appending to the slice.
        - Retrieving a grade takes O(1) time since it's a direct lookup in the map.
        - Sorting the student names in the Enrollment method takes O(m log m), where m is the total number of students across all grades. Sorting the grades themselves takes O(n log n), where n is the number of grades.
    
    - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n + m) due to storing grades and students in the map and slices.

## Conclusion
The Grade School problem can be efficiently implemented in Go using simple data structures like structs and maps. By encapsulating the functionality in a clean interface, we can easily manage student enrollment and retrieval based on grades, ensuring that the system is both efficient and easy to use.
