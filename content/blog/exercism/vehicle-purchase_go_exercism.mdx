# Vehicle Purchase!

In this article, we will explore the "Vehicle Purchase!" problem from Exercism and provide an efficient solution using Go. The problem involves determining whether a license is needed for different types of vehicles, recommending vehicles, and calculating their resale prices based on age.

## Problem Statement

The task requires us to implement three functions:
1. **NeedsLicense**: Determine if a license is required to drive a specified type of vehicle.
2. **ChooseVehicle**: Recommend which of two vehicle options is better based on lexicographical order.
3. **CalculateResellPrice**: Calculate the resale price of a vehicle based on its original price and age.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we will implement the three functions, ensuring that they adhere to the specified requirements:

1. **NeedsLicense** should return `true` for "car" and "truck", and `false` for all other vehicle types.
2. **ChooseVehicle** should compare the two vehicle options and return the one that comes first alphabetically.
3. **CalculateResellPrice** should calculate the resale price according to the given age brackets.

### Implementation in Go

Below is the Go implementation for the problem:

```go
package purchase

// NeedsLicense determines whether a license is needed to drive a type of vehicle. Only "car" and "truck" require a license.
func NeedsLicense(kind string) bool {
	return kind == "car" || kind == "truck"
}

// ChooseVehicle recommends a vehicle for selection. It always recommends the vehicle that comes first in lexicographical order.
func ChooseVehicle(option1, option2 string) string {
	if option1 < option2 {
		return option1 + " is clearly the better choice."
	}
	return option2 + " is clearly the better choice."
}

// CalculateResellPrice calculates how much a vehicle can resell for at a certain age.
func CalculateResellPrice(originalPrice, age float64) float64 {
	var resellPrice float64
	if age < 3 {
		resellPrice = originalPrice * 0.8
	} else if age >= 10 {
		resellPrice = originalPrice * 0.5
	} else {
		resellPrice = originalPrice * 0.7
	}
	return resellPrice
}
```

### Explanation
1. **NeedsLicense**:

- This function checks if the given vehicle type requires a license. It returns true if the vehicle is either a "car" or "truck", and false otherwise.

2. **ChooseVehicle**:

- This function compares two vehicle options and returns the one that is lexicographically smaller, indicating it as the better choice.

3. **CalculateResellPrice**:

    - This function calculates the resale price based on the vehicle's original price and its age. The resale price is determined as follows:
        - Less than 3 years old: 80% of the original price.
        - 3 to 9 years old: 70% of the original price.
        - 10 years or older: 50% of the original price.


### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**:
        - All functions have a time complexity of O(1), as they perform a constant amount of work regardless of the input size.

    - **Space Complexity**:
       - The space complexity is also O(1) since we do not use any additional data structures that grow with input size.


## Conclusion
In this article, we examined the "Vehicle Purchase!" problem and implemented a solution using Go. The functions we created efficiently determine license requirements, recommend vehicles, and calculate resale prices. This problem serves as a great exercise in basic programming concepts, including conditionals and simple arithmetic operations.
