## Problem Statement

In the Grains problem, the task is based on an ancient story about a chessboard and grains of wheat. Starting with one grain on the first square, the number of grains doubles on each subsequent square. The goal is to calculate:
1. How many grains are on a specific square, given its position (1 to 64).
2. The total number of grains on the chessboard.

The grain count for a square can be expressed as 2^(position-1), meaning that the number of grains on square 1 is 1, on square 2 is 2, on square 3 is 4, and so on.

## Approach

### Algorithm

1. **Square Function**:
   - Validate the input to ensure that the square number is between 1 and 64 (inclusive). If the number is outside this range, return an error.
   - Use bit shifting to calculate the grains on a given square. For a given position, the number of grains is 2^(position-1), which can be computed as `1 << (position - 1)`.

2. **Total Function**:
   - The total number of grains on the chessboard is the sum of grains on all 64 squares. This is equal to 2^64 - 1, which can be computed directly using bit shifting: `1 << 64 - 1`.


### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go implementation to solve the Grains problem:

```go
package grains

import "errors"

// Square calculates the number of grains on the given square.
func Square(number int) (uint64, error) {
	if number < 1 || number > 64 {
		return 0, errors.New("number must be between 1 and 64")
	}

	// Calculate grains using bit shifting.
	return (1 << uint(number-1)), nil
}

// Total calculates the total number of grains on the chessboard.
func Total() uint64 {
	// Total grains is 2^64 - 1.
	return 1<<64 - 1
}
```

### Explanation

  - **Square Function**: 
    - The function `Square()` checks if the input square number is between 1 and 64. If the number is valid, it uses bitwise shifting (`1 << (number-1)`) to calculate the number of grains on the given square. This operation is equivalent to computing 2^(number-1).
    
  - **Total Function**: 
    - The function `Total()` calculates the total number of grains on the chessboard using a similar bitwise operation. The total grains is equal to 2^64 - 1, which can be computed as `1 << 64 - 1`. This represents the sum of all grains on the 64 squares.


### Time and Space Complexity

  - **Time Complexity**: O(1)
    - The bitwise shifting operation takes constant time regardless of the input, making the time complexity for both `Square()` and `Total()` O(1).
    
  - **Space Complexity**: O(1)
    - Both functions only use a constant amount of space to store intermediate values and the result. Therefore, the space complexity is also O(1).

## Conclusion

The Grains problem can be efficiently solved using bitwise operations in Go. The `Square()` function calculates the number of grains on any given square using bit shifting, while the `Total()` function computes the total grains on the entire chessboard. Both functions have constant time and space complexity, making the solution optimal for this problem.
