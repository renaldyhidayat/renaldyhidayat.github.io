## Problem Statement

In chess, a queen can move any number of squares along a row, column, or diagonal. The Queen Attack problem involves determining whether one queen can attack another on a chessboard. Given two positions in standard chess notation (e.g., "a1", "h8"), the task is to check if the first queen can attack the second queen.

## Approach

To solve the problem, we need to check if the two positions are in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we need to validate the positions to ensure they are within the bounds of the chessboard.

### Algorithm

1. Validate the input positions to ensure they are on the chessboard and not the same square.
2. Check if the queens are in the same column (same file).
3. Check if the queens are in the same row (same rank).
4. Check if the queens are on the same diagonal by comparing the differences in their row and column positions.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package queenattack

import "errors"

func CanQueenAttack(s1, s2 string) (bool, error) {
	if s1 == s2 {
		return false, errors.New("same square")
	}

	s1x := s1[0]
	s1y := s1[1]
	s2x := s2[0]
	s2y := s2[1]

	if s1x < 'a' || s1x > 'h' ||
		s2x < 'a' || s2x > 'h' ||
		s1y < '1' || s1y > '8' ||
		s2y < '1' || s2y > '8' {
		return false, errors.New("out of bounds")
	}

	if s1x == s2x || s1y == s2y {
		return true, nil
	}

	for x := -1; x <= 1; x += 2 {
		for y := -1; y <= 1; y += 2 {
			curX := int(s1x)
			curY := int(s1y)

			for curX >= 'a' && curX <= 'h' && curY >= '1' && curY <= '8' {
				if curX == int(s2x) && curY == int(s2y) {
					return true, nil
				}

				curX += x
				curY += y
			}
		}
	}
	return false, nil
}
```

### Explanation
    - The CanQueenAttack function first checks if the two positions are the same and validates the input against chessboard boundaries.
    - It then checks if both queens are in the same column or row, which would allow an attack.
    - Finally, it checks for diagonals by iterating through possible diagonal movements until the edge of the board is reached.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: O(1). The algorithm performs a constant number of checks regardless of the input size, as the chessboard is a fixed size (8x8).
    - **Space Complexity**: O(1). The function uses a fixed amount of space for variables.

## Conclusion
The Queen Attack solution provides a simple and efficient way to determine if one queen can attack another on a chessboard. The implementation effectively utilizes validation and logical checks to ensure correct functionality, demonstrating a clear understanding of chess movement rules.
