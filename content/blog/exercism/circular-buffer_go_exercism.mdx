## Problem Statement

The Circular Buffer problem requires the implementation of a buffer that can store a fixed number of bytes and manage data in a circular manner. The buffer should support two types of writes: overflow-checked writes, which return an error if the buffer is full, and unconditional writes that overwrite the oldest data when the buffer is full.

## Approach

To solve the Circular Buffer problem, we will:
1. Define a `Buffer` struct to hold the buffer data, start and end indices, and the current count of bytes.
2. Implement methods for reading and writing bytes, overwriting bytes, and resetting the buffer.
3. Ensure that the methods handle circular behavior correctly by using modulo arithmetic.

### Algorithm

1. **Initialization**: Create a buffer with a fixed size, initializing the start, end, and count variables.
2. **Reading a Byte**: Retrieve the byte at the start index, move the start index forward, and update the count.
3. **Writing a Byte**: Check if the buffer is full. If not, write the byte at the end index, move the end index forward, and update the count.
4. **Overwriting**: If the buffer is full, overwrite the byte at the start index and adjust the start index accordingly.
5. **Resetting**: Set all indices and count back to their initial values.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package circular

import "errors"

type Buffer struct {
	buff              []byte
	start, end, count int
}

func NewBuffer(size int) *Buffer {
	if size <= 0 {
		return nil
	}

	buff := &Buffer{
		start: 0,
		end:   0,
		buff:  make([]byte, size),
	}

	return buff
}

func (b *Buffer) ReadByte() (byte, error) {
	if b.count == 0 {
		return 0, errors.New("empty buffer")
	}

	c := b.buff[b.start]

	b.start++

	b.start %= len(b.buff)

	b.count--

	return c, nil
}

func (b *Buffer) WriteByte(c byte) error {
	if b.count == len(b.buff) {
		return errors.New("full buffer")
	}

	b.buff[b.end] = c

	b.end++
	b.end %= len(b.buff)

	b.count++

	return nil
}

func (b *Buffer) Overwrite(c byte) {
	if b.count != len(b.buff) {
		b.WriteByte(c)
	} else {
		b.buff[b.start] = c
		b.start++
		b.start %= len(b.buff)
	}
}

func (b *Buffer) Reset() {
	b.start, b.end, b.count = 0, 0, 0
}
```


### Explanation
    - The Buffer struct manages the circular buffer's state, including the underlying byte slice, start and end indices, and the count of currently stored bytes.
    - The NewBuffer function initializes a new buffer of a specified size.
    - The ReadByte method retrieves and removes a byte from the start of the buffer, updating the indices accordingly.
    - The WriteByte method adds a byte to the end of the buffer if there is space.
    - The Overwrite method allows writing a byte that will replace the oldest byte in the buffer if it's full.
    - The Reset method clears the buffer, preparing it for new data.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: O(1) for reading, writing, overwriting, and resetting operations, as they all involve a constant number of steps.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the size of the buffer, as the buffer needs space for storing the bytes.

## Conclusion
The Circular Buffer implementation in Go efficiently manages byte storage in a circular manner, providing both overflow-checked and unconditional writing capabilities. This design allows for flexible data handling in scenarios where memory constraints or data streaming are essential
