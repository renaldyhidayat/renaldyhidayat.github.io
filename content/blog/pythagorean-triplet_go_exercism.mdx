## Problem Statement

The task is to find Pythagorean triplets within a specified range. A Pythagorean triplet consists of three positive integers a, b, and c such that a^2 + b^2 = c^2. Additionally, for a valid triplet, a < b < c should hold true.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we can utilize a brute force approach by iterating through possible values of a and b, and calculating c. We then check whether c is a whole number and lies within the specified range.

### Algorithm

1. **Range Function**: 
   - Iterate through integers a and b within the specified range.
   - Calculate c using the formula c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2).
   - Check if c is an integer and if a < b < c.

2. **Sum Function**:
   - Use the Range function to generate all possible triplets.
   - Filter the triplets where the sum of a, b, and c equals a given integer p.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package pythagorean

import "math"

type Triplet [3]int

func Range(min, max int) (result []Triplet) {
	for a := min; a <= max-2; a++ {
		for b := a + 1; b <= max-1; b++ {
			c := math.Sqrt(math.Pow(float64(a), 2) + math.Pow(float64(b), 2))
			if c == math.Trunc(c) && c <= float64(max) && float64(b) < c {
				result = append(result, Triplet{a, b, int(c)})
			}
		}
	}
	return result
}

func Sum(p int) (result []Triplet) {
	candidates := Range(0, p)
	for _, candidate := range candidates {
		if candidate[0]+candidate[1]+candidate[2] == p {
			result = append(result, candidate)
		}
	}
	return result
}
```

### Explanation
    - The Range function iterates over all integers a and b within the specified range to compute the corresponding c values.
    - It checks if the calculated c is an integer and if it satisfies the condition a < b < c. Valid triplets are collected and returned.
    - The Sum function utilizes the Range function to find all triplets that add up to the provided integer p.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) - The algorithm consists of two nested loops iterating over a and b, which results in a quadratic time complexity.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(k) - Where k is the number of valid triplets found. The space used for storing these triplets scales with the number of valid triplets.

## Conclusion
The Pythagorean triplet problem can be effectively solved using a brute force approach by iterating over potential values of a and b, calculating c, and validating the triplet conditions. The provided Go implementation efficiently addresses the problem by encapsulating the logic within dedicated functions for clarity and reusability.
