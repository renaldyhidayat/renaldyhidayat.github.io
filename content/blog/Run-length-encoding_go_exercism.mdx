## Problem Statement

Run Length Encoding is a simple form of data compression where runs of repeated characters are replaced with a single instance of the character followed by a count of how many times it appears. If a character appears only once, it is represented as itself. The problem also involves decoding such a compressed string back to its original form.

For example:
- Encoding: `"AAAABBBCCDAA"` becomes `"4A3B2C1D2A"`
- Decoding: `"4A3B2C1D2A"` becomes `"AAAABBBCCDAA"`

## Approach

We need to implement two functions:
1. **RunLengthEncode**: Converts the input string into a compressed, encoded format.
2. **RunLengthDecode**: Converts the encoded string back to its original form.

### Algorithm

1. **RunLengthEncode**:
   - Initialize variables to store the current character and count.
   - Loop through the string and count consecutive occurrences of each character.
   - Append the count followed by the character to the result string (omit count if it is 1).
   
2. **RunLengthDecode**:
   - Parse the encoded string, extracting counts and characters.
   - Reconstruct the original string by repeating each character according to its count.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package encode

import (
	"fmt"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
	"unicode"
)

// RunLengthEncode compresses a string using run-length encoding.
func RunLengthEncode(input string) string {
	if input == "" {
		return ""
	}

	var encoded string
	var current rune
	var count int

	for _, r := range input {
		if r != current {
			if count > 0 {
				encoded += encode(current, count)
			}
			current = r
			count = 1
		} else {
			count++
		}
	}
	encoded += encode(current, count)

	return encoded
}

func encode(r rune, count int) string {
	if count == 1 {
		return string(r)
	} else {
		return fmt.Sprintf("%d%c", count, r)
	}
}

// RunLengthDecode decompresses a string using run-length decoding.
func RunLengthDecode(input string) string {
	var decoded string
	countStr := ""
	var count int

	for _, r := range input {
		if unicode.IsDigit(r) {
			countStr += string(r)
		} else {
			if countStr == "" {
				count = 1
			} else {
				count, _ = strconv.Atoi(countStr)
			}
			decoded += decode(r, count)
			countStr = ""
		}
	}
	return decoded
}

func decode(r rune, count int) string {
	return strings.Repeat(string(r), count)
}
```

### Explanation
    - **RunLengthEncode**:

        - We loop through the input string, checking consecutive characters. When a new character is encountered, we append the previous character and its count to the encoded result.
        - The encode function formats the character and count into the appropriate form, omitting the count when it's 1.
    
    - **RunLengthDecode**:

        - The function reads the encoded string, gathering digits as part of the count. When a non-digit character is encountered, it repeats that character according to the count found and appends it to the result.
        - The decode function uses strings.Repeat to repeat the character for the given count.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - #### **RunLengthEncode**:

        - **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. Each character is processed once.
        - **Space Complexity**: O(n), as we store the encoded result, which is proportional to the input size.
    
    - #### **RunLengthDecode**:

        - **Time Complexity**: O(m), where m is the length of the encoded string. Each character and digit is processed once.
        - **Space Complexity**: O(m), as we store the decoded result.

## Conclusion
Run Length Encoding is a simple but effective way to compress repeated characters in a string. By implementing this in Go, we can efficiently handle encoding and decoding of strings. The solution has linear time complexity, making it suitable for processing large strings quickly.
