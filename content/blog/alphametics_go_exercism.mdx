## Problem Statement

**Alphametics** is a puzzle where letters represent unique digits in a mathematical equation. The goal is to replace each letter with a unique digit (0-9) such that the equation is valid. A key constraint is that no number in the equation can start with the digit `0`.

For example, given the equation `SEND + MORE = MONEY`, we need to determine the correct digit for each letter.

## Approach

This problem can be solved by performing a **backtracking search** over possible digit assignments. We assign digits to letters and recursively check if the current assignment satisfies the equation. If a contradiction is found, we backtrack and try a different digit.

### Algorithm

1. **Parse the Puzzle**: 
   - Break the equation into operands and the result (the part after the equals sign). Each operand is a word that represents a number where the digits correspond to letters.
   
2. **Track Letters**:
   - We create a `letters` array to track the value and occurrence of each letter, as well as a flag to indicate whether the letter is a leading character (to prevent assigning it the digit `0`).

3. **Backtracking Search**:
   - We use recursion to assign digits to letters. At each depth of the recursion, we attempt to assign a digit to a letter, ensuring it hasn’t already been used. After assigning a digit, we check if the partial assignment can lead to a solution. If it doesn’t, we backtrack and try another digit.

4. **Summing Words**:
   - For each word, we calculate its numeric value based on the current digit assignment.

5. **Check Equation**:
   - Once all digits are assigned, we check if the sum of the operand words equals the result word. If it does, we have found a valid solution.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package alphametics

import (
	"errors"
	"strings"
)

type char struct {
	val     int
	letter  byte
	leading bool // Letter appears at start of word (cannot be '0')
}

type alphametic struct {
	usedDigits [10]bool
	letters    [26]char
	index      []*char
	operands   []string
}

func Solve(puzzle string) (map[string]int, error) {
	a := alphametic{index: make([]*char, 0, 26)}
	a.operands = strings.FieldsFunc(puzzle, func(r rune) bool { return r == '+' || r == '=' || r == ' ' })

	for _, w := range a.operands {
		a.letters[w[0]-'A'].leading = true

        for _, c := range []byte(w) {
			a.letters[c-'A'].letter = c
		}
	}

	for i := range a.letters {
		if a.letters[i].letter > 0 {
			a.index = append(a.index, &a.letters[i])
		}
	}

    if !a.solveInner(0) {
		return nil, errors.New("no solution")
	}

    result := make(map[string]int, len(a.index))

    for _, v := range a.index {
		result[string(v.letter)] = v.val
	}

    return result, nil
}

func (a *alphametic) solveInner(depth int) bool {
	if depth == len(a.index) {
		tot := 0

		for _, o := range a.operands[:len(a.operands)-1] {
			tot += a.sumWord(o)
		}

		return tot == a.sumWord(a.operands[len(a.operands) - 1])
	}

	char := a.index[depth]

	for digit := 0; digit < 10; digit++ {
		if (digit != 0 || !char.leading) && !a.usedDigits[digit] {
			a.usedDigits[digit], char.val = true, digit

            if a.solveInner(depth + 1) {
				return true
			}

			a.usedDigits[digit] = false
		}
	}

	return false
}

func (a *alphametic) sumWord(word string) (sum int) {
	for _, c := range []byte(word) {
		sum = 10 * sum + a.letters[c - 'A'].val
	}

	return sum
}
```

### Explanation
    - **Puzzle Parsing**: The puzzle is parsed into words, with the = symbol splitting the operands from the result.
    - **Tracking Letters**: We store information about each letter, ensuring that leading characters in words cannot be assigned the digit 0.
    - **Backtracking**: The core of the algorithm uses recursion to try different digit assignments, undoing assignments if they lead to an invalid state (i.e., if the equation doesn’t hold).
    - **Summing Words**: The numeric value of each word is computed by interpreting the letters as digits, which is then used to check the validity of the equation.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity***: The time complexity is O(10^n) in the worst case, where n is the number of distinct letters in the puzzle. Each letter can take on one of 10 possible digits, leading to exponential growth in the search space.
    - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of distinct letters, since we need to track digit assignments and previous states during recursion.


## Conclusion
The Alphametics puzzle is a classic example of using backtracking to solve constraint satisfaction problems. By recursively trying different digit assignments, we can efficiently find a solution that satisfies the equation. Go's data structures and recursion provide a clean and performant way to approach this problem.
