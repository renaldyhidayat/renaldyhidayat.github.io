## Problem Statement

The Nth Prime problem requires determining the nth prime number. The input `n` specifies which prime number to return. If `n` is less than or equal to zero, the function should return an error indicating that the input is invalid.

## Approach

### Algorithm

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Check if `n` is less than 1. If so, return an error indicating invalid input.

2. **Finding the Nth Prime**:
   - Initialize two counters: one to count how many prime numbers have been found (`nth`), and another to iterate through natural numbers (`count`).
   - Use an infinite loop to check each number (`count`) to see if it is prime.
   - Increment the prime count (`nth`) when a prime number is found.
   - When `nth` equals `n`, return the current value of `count` as the nth prime.

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go implementation of the Nth Prime functionality:

```go
// Package prime provides functionality to find the nth prime number.
package prime

import (
	"errors"
	"math"
)

// Nth returns the nth prime number. An error is returned if the input is invalid.
func Nth(n int) (int, error) {
	if n < 1 {
		return 0, errors.New("invalid input")
	}

	nth := 0
	count := 0

	for {
		count++

		if isPrime(count) {
			nth++
		}

		if nth == n {
			return count, nil
		}
	}
}

// isPrime checks if a number is prime.
func isPrime(n int) bool {
	if n < 2 {
		return false
	}

	sqrt := int(math.Sqrt(float64(n)))

	for i := 2; i <= sqrt; i++ {
		if n%i == 0 {
			return false
		}
	}

	return true
}
```

### Explanation
    - **Nth Function**: This function calculates the nth prime number. It validates the input and uses a loop to check each number for primality. The helper function isPrime determines whether a number is prime, and the count of primes found is tracked until the nth prime is reached.

    - **isPrime Function**: This helper function checks whether a number is prime by testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - #### **Time Complexity**: O(n * âˆšm)

        Where n is the nth prime to be found, and m is the maximum number checked for primality. The function may need to check several numbers to find the nth prime.
    - #### **Space Complexity**: O(1)

        - The space used is constant since only a few integer variables are maintained, irrespective of the input size.

## Conclusion
The Nth Prime problem is efficiently solved in Go with a clear approach involving input validation and primality testing. The algorithm ensures correctness while maintaining a straightforward implementation, making it suitable for finding prime numbers for various input scenarios.
