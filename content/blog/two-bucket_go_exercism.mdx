## Problem Statement

In the **Two Bucket** problem, you are given two buckets of different capacities and a goal amount of water. Your task is to determine the fewest steps required to measure exactly the goal amount of water by either filling, emptying, or transferring water between the buckets. Additionally, you need to track which bucket starts with the operation and how much water remains in the other bucket when the goal is reached.

### Key Operations:
- Fill a bucket.
- Empty a bucket.
- Transfer water from one bucket to the other until one bucket is either full or empty.

## Approach

To solve the Two Bucket problem efficiently, we use a **breadth-first search (BFS)** approach where each state (iteration) is represented as a configuration of the two buckets. We keep track of all previous states to avoid revisiting them, and we explore every possible operation in order to reach the goal amount.

### Algorithm

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with both buckets empty.
   - Track which bucket starts the operation.
   
2. **Operations**:
   - Perform all possible operations at each step: fill a bucket, empty a bucket, or transfer water between buckets.
   - Each time we generate a new configuration, we check whether the current state has been seen before. If it has, we discard it; if it hasn't, we continue exploring that state.

3. **Goal Check**:
   - If one of the buckets reaches the goal amount, we return the number of steps taken and the amount of water in the other bucket.

4. **Invalid Configurations**:
   - If it is mathematically impossible to measure the goal amount based on the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the bucket sizes, return an error.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package twobucket

import (
	"errors"
	"log"
)

var allOperations = []string{
	"one",
	"two",
	"empty(one)",
	"empty(two)",
	"one->two",
	"two->one",

	bucketOne   int
	bucketTwo   int
	sizeOne     int
	sizeTwo     int
	startBucket string

	operation  string
	prev       []string
	prevStates [][2]int

	// is empty and the other bucket is full.

Explanation
Iteration Struct: Represents the state of the two buckets at each step, tracking their contents, the current operation, and the previous states to avoid cycles.
Solution Struct: Holds the goal amount and the queue of iterations to be explored.
Solve Function: Initializes the problem, checks for impossible cases using GCD, and starts the solution process.
Find Function: Implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore possible operations and find the solution.
Operations: The program simulates all possible operations and checks if they lead to the goal state.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: The worst-case scenario involves exploring all possible states of the two buckets. Since each bucket can have sizeOne + 1 and sizeTwo + 1 states, the time complexity is approximately O(sizeOne * sizeTwo).
    - **Space Complexity**: The space required to store the queue and visited states is also proportional to the number of bucket states, making the space complexity O(sizeOne * sizeTwo).

## Conclusion
The Two Bucket problem can be efficiently solved using a breadth-first search approach, leveraging a map of previous states to avoid revisiting configurations. This Go implementation provides an elegant solution to determine the fewest steps required to measure the goal amount of water.
