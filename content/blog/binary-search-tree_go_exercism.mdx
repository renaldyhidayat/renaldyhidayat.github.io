## Problem Statement

The Binary Search Tree (BST) is a data structure that facilitates efficient searching, insertion, and sorting of data. Each node in a BST contains a value, a pointer to the left child, and a pointer to the right child. The left subtree contains values less than the node's value, while the right subtree contains values greater than or equal to the node's value.

## Approach

To implement a Binary Search Tree, we need to provide methods for:
1. Inserting new values into the tree.
2. Retrieving sorted values from the tree.

### Algorithm

1. **Node Structure**: Define a structure for the BST node that includes pointers to left and right children, as well as an integer for the node's value.
2. **Insert Method**: 
   - If the tree is empty, create a new node.
   - If the value to be inserted is less than or equal to the current node's value, move to the left child. If there's no left child, insert the new node there; otherwise, continue down the left subtree.
   - If the value is greater than the current node's value, repeat the process for the right child.
3. **Sorted Data Method**: 
   - Traverse the left subtree, then the current node, and finally the right subtree, collecting values in sorted order.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package binarysearchtree

type BinarySearchTree struct {
	left  *BinarySearchTree
	data  int
	right *BinarySearchTree
}

func NewBst(i int) *BinarySearchTree {
	return &BinarySearchTree{data: i}
}

func (bst *BinarySearchTree) Insert(i int) {
	if bst == nil {
		return
	}

	if i <= bst.data {
		if bst.left == nil {
			bst.left = NewBst(i)
		} else {
			bst.left.Insert(i)
		}
	} else {
		if bst.right == nil {
			bst.right = NewBst(i)
		} else {
			bst.right.Insert(i)
		}
	}
}

func (bst *BinarySearchTree) SortedData() []int {
	if bst == nil {
		return []int{}
	}

	return append(append(bst.left.SortedData(), bst.data), bst.right.SortedData()...)
}
```

### Explanation
    - **Structure**: The BinarySearchTree struct represents each node with pointers to left and right children, and an integer for the node's value.
    - **NewBst Function**: This function initializes a new BST with a given value.
    - **Insert Method**: The method checks where to insert the new value based on the BST properties, ensuring the tree maintains its ordered structure.
    - **SortedData Method**: This method returns a slice of integers containing the values of the nodes in sorted order by performing an in-order traversal.

### Time and Space Complexity

    - **Time Complexity**:
        - **Insert**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), this could be O(n), where n is the number of nodes.
        - **SortedData**: O(n), as it visits every node in the tree.
        
    - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the result of the sorted data, assuming we collect all values.

## Conclusion
The Binary Search Tree is a fundamental data structure that provides efficient data handling capabilities. This implementation in Go includes methods for inserting values and retrieving sorted data, demonstrating the efficiency of BST operations.
