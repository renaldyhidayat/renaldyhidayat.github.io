## Problem Statement

The goal is to implement a binary search algorithm that efficiently finds the index of a specified key in a sorted list of integers. If the key is found, the function should return its index; if not, it should return -1.

## Approach

Binary search is a classic algorithm that works on the principle of divide and conquer. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half and compares the middle element with the key. If the key is equal to the middle element, the search is successful. If the key is less than the middle element, the search continues on the left half, and if greater, on the right half.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, representing the boundaries of the search interval.
2. While `left` is less than `right`:
   - Calculate the middle index `mid`.
   - If the element at `mid` is equal to the key, return `mid`.
   - If the key is less than the element at `mid`, adjust `right` to `mid`.
   - If the key is greater, adjust `left` to `mid + 1`.
3. If the key is not found, return -1.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package binarysearch

func SearchInts(list []int, key int) int {
	for left, right := 0, len(list); left != right; {
		mid := (left + right) / 2

		switch {
		case list[mid] == key:
			return mid
		case key < list[mid]:
			right = mid
		default:
			left = mid + 1
		}
	}

	return -1
}
```

### Explanation
    - The SearchInts function takes a sorted slice of integers and a key to search for.
    - It uses a loop to adjust the left and right pointers based on comparisons between the middle element and the key.
    - If the key is found, the index is returned; otherwise, -1 is returned after the loop concludes without finding the key.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: O(log n) - Each iteration reduces the size of the search interval by half, leading to logarithmic time complexity.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(1) - The algorithm uses a constant amount of additional space, independent of the input size.

## Conclusion
Binary search is a highly efficient algorithm for searching in sorted lists, significantly outperforming linear search methods for large datasets. The Go implementation provided effectively demonstrates the core principles of binary search with clear logic and concise code.
