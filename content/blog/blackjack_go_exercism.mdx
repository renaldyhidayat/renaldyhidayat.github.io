# BlackJack!

In this article, we’ll solve the BlackJack! problem, where the task is to make decisions based on a simplified version of the popular card game Blackjack. We'll write functions to parse card values and make a decision for the player's first turn.

## Problem Statement

The game requires two key functionalities:
1. **ParseCard**: Given the name of a card, return its corresponding value in Blackjack.
2. **FirstTurn**: Given the values of two cards from the player and one card from the dealer, return a decision based on the sum of the player's cards and the dealer’s card. Possible decisions are:
   - "P" for a Pair
   - "W" for a Win
   - "S" for Stand
   - "H" for Hit

## Approach

### Algorithm

The approach is broken down into two parts:
1. **ParseCard**: We'll map card names like "ace", "two", "king" to their respective values based on Blackjack rules.
2. **FirstTurn**: The sum of the player’s cards will determine the action. Special cases for pairs of aces (two aces) and a score of 21 will result in either a "Win" or "Stand". For other sums, we evaluate the dealer’s card and determine whether to "Stand" or "Hit".

### Implementation in Go

```go
package blackjack

var cards = map[string]int{
	"ace":   11,
	"two":   2,
	"three": 3,
	"four":  4,
	"five":  5,
	"six":   6,
	"seven": 7,
	"eight": 8,
	"nine":  9,
	"ten":   10,
	"jack":  10,
	"queen": 10,
	"king":  10,
}

// ParseCard returns the integer value of a card following blackjack ruleset.
func ParseCard(card string) int {
	return cards[card]
}

// FirstTurn returns the decision for the first turn, given two cards of the
// player and one card of the dealer.
func FirstTurn(card1, card2, dealerCard string) string {
	sum := cards[card1] + cards[card2]
	switch {
	case sum == 22: // Two aces
		return "P"
	case sum == 21: // Blackjack
		if cards[dealerCard] < 10 {
			return "W"
		}
		return "S"
	case sum >= 17 && sum <= 20:
		return "S"
	case sum >= 12 && sum <= 16:
		if cards[dealerCard] >= 7 {
			return "H"
		}
		return "S"
	default:
		return "H"
	}
}

```

### Explanation

1. **ParseCard**:
    - We use a map to associate card names with their respective Blackjack values. The ParseCard function simply looks up the card's name in the map and returns the corresponding value.

        Example:

        ```go
        ParseCard("ace")   // Output: 11
        ParseCard("queen") // Output: 10

        ```
2. **FirstTurn**:
    - This function decides the player's action based on the sum of their two cards and the dealer's card.
    - **Special Case**: If both of the player's cards are aces (sum == 22), the function returns "P" (Pair).
    - **Blackjack**: If the sum of the player's cards is exactly 21, the player wins ("W") if the dealer’s card value is less than 10; otherwise, the player stands ("S").
    - **Stand**: If the sum is between 17 and 20, the player should stand ("S").
    - **Hit**: If the sum is between 12 and 16, and the dealer’s card is 7 or higher, the player should hit ("H"). Otherwise, they should stand ("S").
    - **Hit**: If the sum is below 12, the player should always hit ("H").

        Example:
        ```go
        FirstTurn("ace", "king", "three") // Output: "W"
        FirstTurn("nine", "seven", "queen") // Output: "S"

        ```


### **Time and Space Complexity**

    - ####  **Time Complexity**:
        - **ParseCard**: O(1) because accessing an element in a map has constant time complexity.
        - **FirstTurn**: O(1) since we are performing simple arithmetic and conditional checks based on predefined rules.

    - ####  **Space Complexity**:

        - Both functions operate with constant space, O(1), since there is no dynamic memory allocation proportional to the input size.

## Conclusion

By using a map to store card values and writing simple conditional logic in FirstTurn, we can efficiently solve the BlackJack! problem. The solution handles all possible game situations for the first turn, including pairs of aces, blackjack, and standard cases, providing the appropriate action (hit, stand, win, or pair) based on the player's and dealer's cards.
