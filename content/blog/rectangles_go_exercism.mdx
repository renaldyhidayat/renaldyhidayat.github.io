## Problem Statement

The task is to count the number of rectangles formed by a given set of lines represented in a grid. Each rectangle is defined by its four corners marked with `+` and its edges represented by `-` (horizontal) and `|` (vertical). The function should correctly identify and count all such rectangles in the provided grid.

## Approach

To solve the problem, we will:
1. Identify all vertices marked with `+`.
2. Check each pair of vertices to determine if they can form the opposite corners of a rectangle.
3. Verify that the edges of the rectangle are properly formed by checking for horizontal and vertical lines.

### Algorithm

1. **Finding Vertices**: Traverse the grid to find all points marked with `+` and store their coordinates.
2. **Counting Rectangles**: For each pair of vertices:
   - Check if the first vertex is to the left and below the second vertex.
   - Verify the connections between these points to confirm the edges of the rectangle.
3. **Return the Count**: After checking all pairs, return the total count of rectangles.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package rectangles

func Count(lines []string) int {
	h := len(lines)

	if h == 0 {
		return 0
	}

	w := len(lines[0])

	if w == 0 {
		return 0
	}

	vertices := findVertices(lines)

	count := 0

	for _, p := range vertices {
		for _, q := range vertices {
			if p[0] < q[0] && p[1] < q[1] && connected(p, q, lines) {
				count++
			}
		}
	}

	return count
}

type Point [2]int

func findVertices(lines []string) []Point {
	vertices := []Point{}

	for y, row := range lines {
		for x, c := range row {
			if c == '+' {
				vertices = append(vertices, Point{x, y})
			}
		}
	}

	return vertices
}

func connected(p0, p1 Point, lines []string) bool {
	x0 := p0[0]
	y0 := p0[1]

	x1 := p1[0]
	y1 := p1[1]

	if lines[y0][x1] != '+' || lines[y1][x0] != '+' {
		return false
	}

	for _, c0 := range lines[y0][x0:x1] {
		for _, c1 := range lines[y1][x0:x1] {
			if (c0 != '-' && c0 != '+') || (c1 != '-' && c1 != '+') {
				return false
			}
		}
	}

	for _, row := range lines[y0:y1] {
		c0 := row[x0]
		c1 := row[x1]

		if (c0 != '|' && c0 != '+') || (c1 != '|' && c1 != '+') {
			return false
		}
	}

	return true
}
```

### Explanation
    - **Count Function**: This is the main function that coordinates the counting of rectangles. It first checks the grid dimensions and retrieves all the vertices.
    - **findVertices Function**: This function identifies and returns all the points in the grid marked with +.
    - **connected Function**: It verifies if two given points can form a rectangle by checking the required connections (horizontal and vertical lines) between the points.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the number of vertices. For each pair of vertices, we need to check the conditions for forming a rectangle.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of vertices, since we store the coordinates of the vertices in a slice.

## Conclusion
This implementation effectively counts the rectangles formed by the given grid representation using a structured approach to identify vertices and validate their connections. The method can handle various grid configurations and efficiently determine the number of rectangles.
