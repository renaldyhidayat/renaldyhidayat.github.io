## Problem Statement

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a method of securely sharing cryptographic keys over a public channel. It allows two parties to generate a shared secret key that can be used for secure communication. The method relies on the mathematical properties of modular arithmetic and the difficulty of solving discrete logarithm problems.

## Approach

To implement the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, the following steps are taken:
1. **Generate a private key**: A private key is generated for each party, which is kept secret.
2. **Generate a public key**: Each party computes their public key using a given prime number and a base. The public key is shared with the other party.
3. **Compute the shared secret**: Each party computes the shared secret using their private key and the other party's public key. This shared secret can then be used for encryption.

### Algorithm

1. **Private Key Generation**: Generate a random integer in the range [2, p-1] where p is a large prime number.
2. **Public Key Generation**: Compute the public key using the formula:
   \[
   \text{PublicKey} = g^{\text{PrivateKey}} \mod p
   \]
   where g is a base (also known as the generator).
3. **Shared Secret Key Generation**: Compute the shared secret key using the formula:
   \[
   \text{SecretKey} = (\text{PublicKey}_2)^{\text{PrivateKey}_1} \mod p
   \]
   where `PublicKey_2` is the public key of the other party, and `PrivateKey_1` is the private key of the current party.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package diffiehellman

import (
	"crypto/rand"
	"math/big"
)

// PrivateKey generates a private key based on the prime number p.
func PrivateKey(p *big.Int) *big.Int {
	min := big.NewInt(2)
	max := new(big.Int).Sub(p, min)
	n, err := rand.Int(rand.Reader, max)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	return n.Add(n, min)
}

// PublicKey generates a public key based on the private key, prime number p, and base g.
func PublicKey(private, p *big.Int, g int64) *big.Int {
	pp := big.NewInt(g)
	return pp.Exp(pp, private, p)
}

// NewPair generates a new pair of private and public keys based on the prime number p and base g.
func NewPair(p *big.Int, g int64) (*big.Int, *big.Int) {
	private := PrivateKey(p)
	public := PublicKey(private, p, g)
	return private, public
}

// SecretKey computes the secret key based on the private key of one party, the public key of the other party, and prime number p.
func SecretKey(private1, public2, p *big.Int) *big.Int {
	s := new(big.Int)
	return s.Exp(public2, private1, p)
}
```

## Explanation
    - **PrivateKey**: This function generates a random private key between 2 and p-1. It uses the crypto/rand package to ensure cryptographic security.
    - **PublicKey**: Given a private key, a prime number, and a base, this function computes the public key using modular exponentiation.

    - **NewPair**: This function generates a new pair of private and public keys.
    - **SecretKey**: It computes the shared secret key using the private key of one party and the public key of the other party.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity for generating keys and computing the shared secret is O(log p) due to the modular exponentiation.
    - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) since we only store a fixed number of integers regardless of the input size.

## Conclusion
The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a foundational technique in cryptography that enables secure communication between parties over a public channel. By implementing this algorithm in Go, we can effectively generate and exchange keys to establish a secure connection, leveraging the mathematical principles of modular arithmetic.
