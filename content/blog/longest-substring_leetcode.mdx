## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: `s = "abcabcbb"`
Output: `3`
Explanation: The answer is `"abc"`, with the length of 3.
```
### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: `s = "bbbbb"`
Output: `1`
Explanation: The answer is `"b"`, with the length of 1.
```

### Example 3:

```plaintext
Input: `s = "pwwkew"`
Output: `3`
Explanation: The answer is `"wke"`, with the length of 3. Notice that the answer must be a substring, `"pwke"` is a subsequence, not a substring.
```
### Constraints:
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.

## Approach
To solve the "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" problem, we can use the sliding window technique. The sliding window is a flexible tool for solving problems where we need to check a substring or subarray, and it allows us to efficiently explore possible solutions without recomputing the whole window from scratch each time.

### Sliding Window Concept
Window Definition: The sliding window is defined by two pointers, left and right, which represent the start and end of the current substring.
Expanding the Window: We move the right pointer to include new characters into the window.
Contracting the Window: If a duplicate character is encountered (i.e., a character that already exists within the current window), we move the left pointer to remove characters until the duplicate is no longer in the window.
Tracking the Longest Substring: At each step, we calculate the length of the current valid substring and keep track of the maximum length found so far.

### Key Observations
The substring must not contain repeating characters, meaning that each time we encounter a duplicate, we need to shrink the window.
We use a bitset (boolean array) to track the characters in the current window. This helps in determining whether the current character is a duplicate.
At each step, we update the result with the length of the current substring if it's the longest we've seen so far.

### Algorithm

We can solve this problem using the sliding window technique. The sliding window technique allows us to efficiently check all substrings while only iterating over the string once.

1. **Sliding Window**: We use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the current window of the substring.
2. **Bitset Array**: We maintain a boolean array `bitset` of size 256 (ASCII characters) to track whether a character exists in the current window.
3. **Expanding and Contracting**: 
   - As we move the `right` pointer across the string, we check if the current character is already in the substring.
   - If it is, we shrink the window by moving the `left` pointer.
   - If not, we expand the window and update the result.
4. **Result Calculation**: At each step, we calculate the length of the current window and update the result if it's larger than the previous value.

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go implementation of the solution:


```go
package main

import "fmt"

// LengthOfLongestSubstring finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters
func LengthOfLongestSubstring(s string) int {
    if len(s) == 0 {
        return 0
    }

    var bitset [256]bool
    result, left, right := 0, 0, 0

    // Sliding window with two pointers
    for left < len(s) {
        if bitset[s[right]] {
            bitset[s[left]] = false
            left++ // Shrink the window
        } else {
            bitset[s[right]] = true
            right++ // Expand the window
        }

        // Update the result if the current window is larger
        if result < right-left {
            result = right - left
        }

        // Break if we have covered the entire string
        if left+result >= len(s) || right >= len(s) {
            break
        }
    }

    return result
}

func main() {
    s := "abcabcbb"
    fmt.Println(LengthOfLongestSubstring(s)) // Output: 3
}
```

### Implementation in Java

Here is the Java implementation of the solution:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters {
    public static int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        if (s.length() == 0) return 0;

        HashSet<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        int left = 0, right = 0, maxLength = 0;

        while (right < s.length()) {
            if (!set.contains(s.charAt(right))) {
                set.add(s.charAt(right));
                right++;
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left);
            } else {
                set.remove(s.charAt(left));
                left++;
            }
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "abcabcbb";
        System.out.println(lengthOfLongestSubstring(s)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Implementation in TypeScript

Here is the TypeScript implementation of the solution:

```typescript
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: string): number {
    if (s.length === 0) return 0;

    const set = new Set<string>();
    let left = 0, right = 0, maxLength = 0;

    while (right < s.length) {
        if (!set.has(s[right])) {
            set.add(s[right]);
            right++;
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left);
        } else {
            set.delete(s[left]);
            left++;
        }
    }

    return maxLength;
}

// Example usage
const s: string = "abcabcbb";
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring(s)); // Output: 3
```

### Implementation in Python

Here is the Python implementation of the solution:

```python
def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:
    if len(s) == 0:
        return 0

    char_set = set()
    left = right = 0
    max_length = 0

    while right < len(s):
        if s[right] not in char_set:
            char_set.add(s[right])
            right += 1
            max_length = max(max_length, right - left)
        else:
            char_set.remove(s[left])
            left += 1

    return max_length

# Example usage
s = "abcabcbb"
print(length_of_longest_substring(s))  # Output: 3
```

### Explanation

1. **Initial Setup**: We first check if the string s is empty. If it is, we return 0 because there's no substring.
2. **Bitset and Two Pointers**: We initialize a boolean array bitset to track if a character is already in the current window. We also set up two pointers left and right to mark the bounds of the sliding window.
3. Sliding Window:
 - For each character in the string, we check if it has already appeared in the current window.
 - If it has, we move the left pointer to shrink the window.
 - Otherwise, we move the right pointer to expand the window and include the new character.

4. **Result Update**: After each iteration, we check if the current window size (right - left) is larger than the previous result. If so, we update the result.
5. **Termination**: The loop stops when either pointer reaches the end of the string or when the longest possible substring has been found.


### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the string. Each character is visited at most twice (once by the right pointer and once by the left pointer).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) because we use a fixed-size bitset array of 256 elements to track the presence of characters. This space usage does not depend on the input size.


## Conclusion
The sliding window technique provides an efficient way to solve the "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" problem in linear time. By maintaining a bitset and adjusting the window size as we iterate through the string, we can easily track the longest valid substring.
