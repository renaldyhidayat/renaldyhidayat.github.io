## Problem Statement

The **Grep** problem involves creating a simple version of the `grep` command, which searches for a specified pattern in text files. The function should support various flags to modify its behavior, including:

- `-n`: Prefix the line with the line number.
- `-l`: Only output the names of files with matching lines, once for each file.
- `-i`: Ignore case when matching.
- `-v`: Invert the sense of matching, showing lines that do not match the pattern.
- `-x`: Only match whole lines.

## Approach

### Algorithm

1. Parse the provided flags to determine which options are enabled.
2. For each file:
   - Read the file content.
   - Split the content into lines.
   - For each line, apply the specified flags and check if the line matches the pattern.
   - Depending on the matching result and flags, format the output accordingly.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package grep

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strings"
)

func Search(pattern string, flags, files []string) []string {
	var fn, fl, fi, fv, fx bool

	for _, f := range flags {
		switch f {
		case "-n":
			fn = true
		case "-l":
			fl = true
		case "-i":
			fi = true
		case "-v":
			fv = true
		case "-x":
			fx = true
		}
	}

	fm := len(files) > 1

	result := []string{}

	for _, filename := range files {
		data, err := os.ReadFile(filename)

		if err == nil {
			lines := strings.Split(string(data), "\n")

			for i, line := range lines {
				tline := line
				tpattern := pattern

				prefix := ""

				if fi {
					tline = strings.ToLower(tline)
					tpattern = strings.ToLower(tpattern)
				}

				if fm {
					prefix += filename + ":"
				}

				if fn {
					prefix += fmt.Sprintf("%v:", i+1)
				}

				found := strings.Contains(tline, tpattern)

				if fx {
					found = tline == tpattern
				}

				if fl && found {
					result = append(result, filename)
					break
				} else if fv && strings.Trim(tline, " ") != "" && !found {
					result = append(result, prefix+line)
				} else if !fv && found {
					result = append(result, prefix+line)
				}
			}
		}
	}

	return result
}
```

### Explanation
    - **Flag Parsing**: The function begins by parsing the flags provided in the input to set appropriate boolean variables.
    - **File Reading: It iterates through each file, reads its content, and splits it into lines.
    
    - **Line Matching:
        - Each line is processed based on the flags. The pattern may be adjusted for case sensitivity based on the -i flag.
        - Depending on whether the -v, -l, or -x flags are set, the matching logic adjusts how lines are outputted.
        
    - **Output Formatting**: If matching lines are found, they are formatted with line numbers or file names as specified by the flags.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the search function is O(n * m), where n is the number of lines in all files combined and m is the average length of each line. This accounts for reading each line and checking for the pattern.
    - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(k), where k is the number of lines that match the search criteria, as we store these lines in the result slice.

## Conclusion
The Grep implementation in Go efficiently simulates the functionality of the grep command, allowing users to search for patterns across multiple files with various matching options. This showcases the flexibility of Go's string manipulation and file handling capabilities.
