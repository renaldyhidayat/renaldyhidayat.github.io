## Problem Statement

The **Palindrome Products** problem asks you to find the smallest and largest palindromes that can be obtained by multiplying two numbers within a given range. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward.

For example, the number `121` is a palindrome because it reads the same in both directions, while `123` is not.

Given two integers `fmin` and `fmax`, you are to find:
- The smallest palindrome product between numbers in the range `[fmin, fmax]`.
- The largest palindrome product between numbers in the same range.
  
In addition, you should also return the factor pairs that generate those palindrome products.

## Approach

The problem requires iterating over all possible pairs of numbers between `fmin` and `fmax`, calculating their product, and checking if the product is a palindrome. We also need to track the smallest and largest palindromes along with their factor pairs.

### Algorithm

1. **Input Validation**:
   - If `fmin > fmax`, return an error as this is an invalid input range.

2. **Generate Products**:
   - For each pair `(x, y)` where `fmin <= x <= y <= fmax`, calculate the product `p = x * y`.

3. **Check Palindrome**:
   - Convert the product `p` to a string and check if it is a palindrome by comparing the string with its reverse.

4. **Track Smallest and Largest Palindromes**:
   - If the product is smaller than the current smallest palindrome, update the smallest palindrome.
   - If the product is larger than the current largest palindrome, update the largest palindrome.
   - For equal products, append the factor pair to the respective list of factorizations.

5. **Edge Case**:
   - If no palindrome is found, return an error.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package palindrome

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
)

// Product represents a palindrome and its factors.
type Product struct {
	Value          int
	Factorizations [][2]int
}

func reverse(s string) string {
	var result string
	for _, r := range s {
		result = string(r) + result
	}
	return result
}

// Products returns palindromes within the range and their factors.
func Products(fmin, fmax int) (Product, Product, error) {
	if fmin > fmax {
		return Product{}, Product{}, errors.New("fmin > fmax")
	}

	var smallest *Product
	var largest *Product

	for x := fmin; x <= fmax; x++ {
		for y := x; y <= fmax; y++ {
			p := x * y
			ps := fmt.Sprintf("%v", p)
			if ps != reverse(ps) {
				continue
			}

			if smallest == nil || p < smallest.Value {
				smallest = &Product{Value: p, Factorizations: [][2]int{{x, y}}}
			} else if smallest != nil && p == smallest.Value {
				smallest.Factorizations = append(smallest.Factorizations, [2]int{x, y})
			}

			if largest == nil || p > largest.Value {
				largest = &Product{Value: p, Factorizations: [][2]int{{x, y}}}
			} else if largest != nil && p == largest.Value {
				largest.Factorizations = append(largest.Factorizations, [2]int{x, y})
			}
		}
	}

	if smallest == nil || largest == nil {
		return Product{}, Product{}, errors.New("no palindromes")
	}
	return *smallest, *largest, nil
}
```

###Explanation
    - **Palindrome Check**: The function reverse takes a string and returns its reverse. To check if a number is a palindrome, we convert it to a string and check if the string equals its reverse.

    - **Tracking the Smallest and Largest Palindromes**: We use two variables, smallest and largest, to store the smallest and largest palindrome products encountered during the iteration. Each palindrome stores the value of the product and a list of factor pairs that produced it.

    - **Nested Loops**: The outer loop iterates over all numbers x from fmin to fmax, and the inner loop iterates over all numbers y from x to fmax to calculate the product of x * y. We only consider y >= x to avoid duplicate factor pairs (since multiplication is commutative).

    - **Edge Cases**: If no palindromes are found in the range, the function returns an error.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O((fmax - fmin + 1)^2) due to the nested loops that generate all possible factor pairs in the range [fmin, fmax]. Each product check involves reversing the string representation of the product, which takes O(d) time where d is the number of digits in the product.

    - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) for the palindrome checks themselves, but the space required for storing the factor pairs is O(n) where n is the number of palindrome products found.

## Conclusion
The Palindrome Products problem demonstrates a brute-force approach to finding palindromes by checking all possible products of numbers in a given range. While not the most efficient solution, this approach is simple and guarantees correctness within the constraints provided. Through careful iteration and palindrome checking, we can find both the smallest and largest palindromes along with their factor pairs.
