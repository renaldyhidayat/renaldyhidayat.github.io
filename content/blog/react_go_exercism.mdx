## Problem Statement

The **React** problem involves creating a **reactive system** where multiple cells hold values that can change based on dependencies. The cells may be either input cells or compute cells, which calculate their value based on other cells' values. The challenge is to implement this system efficiently, allowing cells to react to changes in their dependencies and notifying observers when their values change.

## Approach

We implement the solution by creating two types of cells: input cells (which can be directly modified) and compute cells (which depend on other cells). Each compute cell recalculates its value based on changes in its dependencies. A reactor is responsible for managing these cells and handling changes, cascading updates, and notifying observers.

### Algorithm

1. **Input and Compute Cells**:
   - Input cells hold values that can be modified directly.
   - Compute cells derive their values based on the values of other cells (input or compute).
   
2. **Reactor**:
   - The reactor manages all the cells and ensures that updates propagate correctly when an input cell changes.
   - Observers can be added to cells, and they are notified when a cell’s value changes.

3. **Triggering Updates**:
   - When an input cell changes, the reactor triggers updates for any dependent compute cells.
   - The update propagates through all cells that depend on the modified cell, recalculating their values as needed.

4. **Observers**:
   - Observers are functions that are called when a cell’s value changes.
   - These can be added and removed dynamically, and the reactor ensures that observers are notified in the correct order.

### Implementation in Go

Below is the Go implementation of the **React** problem:

```go
package react

type reactor struct {
	cells []*cell
}

type cell struct {
	ord       int
	reac      *reactor
	value     int
	consumers []int
	producers []*cell
	compute   func([]int) int
	nextKey   int
	observers map[int]func(int)
}

type canceler struct {
	cancel func()
}

func (c *canceler) Cancel() {
	c.cancel()
}

func (c *cell) Value() int { return c.value }

func (c *cell) SetValue(v int) {
	oldVal := c.value
	c.value = v
	if v != oldVal {
		c.reac.trigger(c)
	}
}

func (c *cell) AddCallback(cb func(int)) Canceler {
	key := c.nextKey
	c.nextKey++
	c.observers[key] = cb
	return &canceler{
		cancel: func() {
			delete(c.observers, key)
		},
	}
}

func New() Reactor {
	return &reactor{}
}

func (r *reactor) CreateInput(initial int) InputCell {
	newCell := &cell{ord: len(r.cells), reac: r, value: initial}
	r.cells = append(r.cells, newCell)
	return newCell
}

func (r *reactor) CreateCompute1(dep Cell, compute func(int) int) ComputeCell {
	d := dep.(*cell)
	newCell := &cell{
		ord:       len(r.cells),
		reac:      r,
		value:     compute(d.value),
		producers: []*cell{d},
		compute:   func(vs []int) int { return compute(vs[0]) },
		observers: make(map[int]func(int)),
	}
	d.consumers = append(d.consumers, newCell.ord)
	r.cells = append(r.cells, newCell)
	return newCell
}

func (r *reactor) CreateCompute2(dep1, dep2 Cell, compute func(int, int) int) ComputeCell {
	d1 := dep1.(*cell)
	d2 := dep2.(*cell)
	newCell := &cell{
		ord:       len(r.cells),
		reac:      r,
		value:     compute(dep1.Value(), dep2.Value()),
		producers: []*cell{d1, d2},
		compute:   func(vs []int) int { return compute(vs[0], vs[1]) },
		observers: make(map[int]func(int)),
	}
	d1.consumers = append(d1.consumers, newCell.ord)
	d2.consumers = append(d2.consumers, newCell.ord)
	r.cells = append(r.cells, newCell)
	return newCell
}

func (r *reactor) trigger(start *cell) {
	bv := newBitv(len(r.cells))
	for _, ord := range start.consumers {
		bv.set(uint(ord))
	}
	for i := start.ord + 1; i < len(r.cells); i++ {
		if !bv.get(uint(i)) {
			continue
		}
		c := r.cells[i]
		vals := make([]int, len(c.producers))
		for i, p := range c.producers {
			vals[i] = p.value
		}
		oldValue := c.value
		c.value = c.compute(vals)
		if oldValue != c.value {
			for _, cb := range c.observers {
				cb(c.value)
			}
			for _, ord := range c.consumers {
				bv.set(uint(ord))
			}
		}
	}
}

type bitv []byte

func newBitv(bits int) bitv {
	return make([]byte, bits/8+1)
}

func (b bitv) get(pos uint) bool {
	return b[pos/8]&(1<<(pos%8)) != 0
}

func (b bitv) set(pos uint) {
	b[pos/8] |= 1 << (pos % 8)
}
```

### Explanation
    - **Reactor**:

        - The reactor struct contains all the cells in the system. It manages the dependencies between cells and ensures that when one cell changes, all dependent cells are updated.
    
    - **Cell**:

        - Each cell struct holds its current value, the list of dependent consumers, and the list of producers it depends on. The compute function is used to calculate its value based on its producers.
    
    - **Trigger Mechanism**:

        - When a cell’s value changes, the reactor triggers updates in all its dependent cells by recalculating their values and propagating changes. This is done efficiently using a bitv (bit vector) to track which cells need to be updated.
    
    - **Observers and Callbacks**:

        - Observers are functions that get called whenever a cell’s value changes. You can add or remove these callbacks dynamically.

### Time and Space Complexity
    - **Time Complexity**:

        - **Triggering Updates**: The time complexity of triggering updates depends on the number of dependent cells. In the worst case, it can be O(n), where n is the total number of cells.
        - **Creating a Cell**: Creating a new cell is O(1) since it only involves appending the cell to the reactor's list.


    - **Space Complexity**:

        - **Bit Vector**: The space complexity for the bit vector is O(n), where n is the number of cells. Each cell also maintains a list of producers, consumers, and observers, contributing to the overall space complexity of the system.

## Conclusion
The React problem is efficiently solved by implementing a reactive system using cells and a reactor. The system allows for dynamic updates, dependency tracking, and observer notifications, all handled with efficient time and space complexity. This solution is ideal for scenarios requiring reactive programming or dynamic updates.
