## Problem Statement

In this problem, you are tasked with creating a character for the game Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). Each character has several attributes:

- Strength
- Dexterity
- Constitution
- Intelligence
- Wisdom
- Charisma

Additionally, each character has hit points, which are calculated as:
`Hitpoints = 10 + Modifier(Constitution)`

The modifier for an ability score is calculated as:
`Modifier = floor((Score - 10) / 2)`

The objective is to generate a new character with randomized ability scores and hit points based on the character’s constitution.

## Approach

We need to:

1. Randomly generate values for the six abilities using a range of 3 to 18.
2. Calculate the modifier for the Constitution score.
3. Use the calculated modifier to determine the character’s hit points.

### Algorithm

1. **Ability Generation**: Each ability score is generated by rolling a random integer between 3 and 18. This represents the possible outcomes in D&D character creation.
2. **Modifier Calculation**: The modifier for each ability is calculated using the formula:
   ``Modifier = floor((Score - 10) / 2)``
3. **Hitpoints Calculation**: The hitpoints are calculated by adding 10 to the constitution modifier.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package dndcharacter

import (
	"math"
	"math/rand"
)

type Character struct {
	Strength     int
	Dexterity    int
	Constitution int
	Intelligence int
	Wisdom       int
	Charisma     int
	Hitpoints    int
}

// Modifier calculates the modifier for a given ability score
func Modifier(score int) int {
	return int(math.Floor(float64((score - 10)) / 2.0))
}

// Ability generates a random ability score between 3 and 18
func Ability() int {
	return rand.Intn(15) + 3
}

// GenerateCharacter creates a new D&D character with random ability scores
func GenerateCharacter() Character {
	char := Character{
		Strength:     Ability(),
		Dexterity:    Ability(),
		Constitution: Ability(),
		Intelligence: Ability(),
		Wisdom:       Ability(),
		Charisma:     Ability(),
	}
	char.Hitpoints = Modifier(char.Constitution) + 10
	return char
}
```

### Explanation

- **Ability**: This function generates a random number between 3 and 18 to represent each character attribute.
- **Modifier**: The `Modifier` function takes an ability score and returns the corresponding modifier based on the formula:  
  `Modifier = (Score - 10) / 2`, rounded down.  
  For example, if the Constitution score is 14, the modifier is `(14 - 10) / 2 = 2`.
- **Hitpoints Calculation**: The hitpoints are calculated by adding the constitution modifier to 10. If a character has a constitution score of 14, their hitpoints will be `10 + 2 = 12`.

- **GenerateCharacter**: This function creates a character by generating random ability scores for each attribute and calculating the hitpoints based on the constitution score.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:

  - Generating each ability score takes constant time, so generating all six attributes is `O(1)`.
  - Calculating the hitpoints involves a single mathematical operation, which is also `O(1)`.
  - Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(1)**.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is **O(1)** as the memory used is constant, and no extra data structures are involved.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently generates a D&D character with random ability scores and calculates hit points based on the character’s constitution. The approach ensures constant time complexity for both the ability generation and the hitpoint calculation, making it optimal for this problem.
