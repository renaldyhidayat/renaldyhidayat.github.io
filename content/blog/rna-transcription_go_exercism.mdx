## Problem Statement

In the RNA Transcription problem, we are required to convert a given DNA strand into its corresponding RNA strand. DNA and RNA are both nucleic acids, but they have different bases. The conversion rules are as follows:

- Guanine (G) in DNA corresponds to Cytosine (C) in RNA.
- Cytosine (C) in DNA corresponds to Guanine (G) in RNA.
- Thymine (T) in DNA corresponds to Adenine (A) in RNA.
- Adenine (A) in DNA corresponds to Uracil (U) in RNA.

Given a string representing a DNA sequence, our task is to return the corresponding RNA sequence.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we will implement a function called `ToRNA`. The steps involved in the implementation are:

1. Initialize an empty string to hold the resulting RNA sequence.
2. Iterate through each character in the input DNA string.
3. For each nucleotide, apply the conversion rules to construct the RNA sequence.
4. Return the resulting RNA string.

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go implementation for the RNA Transcription problem:

```go
package strand

// ToRNA converts to RNA, duh
func ToRNA(dna string) string {
	retVal := ""
	for _, ch := range dna {
		switch ch {
		case 'G':
			retVal += "C"
		case 'C':
			retVal += "G"
		case 'T':
			retVal += "A"
		case 'A':
			retVal += "U"
		}
	}
	return retVal
}
```

### Explanation
- **Function ToRNA**: The function takes a string representing the DNA sequence as input and initializes an empty string retVal to build the RNA sequence.
- **Iteration**: Using a for loop, we iterate over each character in the DNA string.
- **Switch Statement**: A switch statement is employed to check the current nucleotide and append the corresponding RNA nucleotide to retVal:
        If the character is 'G', append 'C'.
        If the character is 'C', append 'G'.
        If the character is 'T', append 'A'.
        If the character is 'A', append 'U'.

- **Return Statement**: Finally, the function returns the constructed RNA sequence.


### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the DNA string, as we need to iterate through each character once.

- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the resulting RNA string, as we store the RNA sequence in a new string.

## Conclusion
The RNA Transcription problem is a straightforward exercise in character mapping and string manipulation. By following the specified conversion rules and constructing the RNA sequence iteratively, we can efficiently transform a DNA strand into its corresponding RNA strand. This implementation in Go demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to solving the problem using basic data structures and control flow.
