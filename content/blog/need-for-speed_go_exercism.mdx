# NeedForSpeed

In this article, we will tackle the **NeedForSpeed** problem. The goal is to simulate a car racing on a track, where we determine if the car can finish the race given its battery life, speed, and battery consumption rate.

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with simulating a car’s progress on a track. The car has a specific speed, a battery that depletes at a certain rate, and a distance it needs to cover on the track. We need to implement:

- **Drive**: Simulates the car driving a certain distance, accounting for battery depletion.
- **CanFinish**: Determines if the car can finish the race given the car's battery status and the track's length.

## Approach

The approach consists of creating two structures:

1. **Car**: Contains properties like `speed`, `battery`, `batteryDrain`, and `distance`.
2. **Track**: Holds the `distance` the car needs to cover.

We need functions to simulate driving, updating the car’s battery and distance, and checking whether the car can finish the race.

### Algorithm

1. **NewCar**: Initializes a new car with a full battery (100%), speed, and battery drain rate.
2. **NewTrack**: Creates a track with the required distance.
3. **Drive**: Simulates driving the car by reducing the battery according to its `batteryDrain`, and increases the distance traveled by its `speed`.
4. **CanFinish**: Checks if the car has enough battery to finish the track by calculating if the battery can sustain the necessary distance.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package speed

type Car struct {
	battery      int
	batteryDrain int
	speed        int
	distance     int
}
type Track struct {
	distance int
}

// NewCar creates a new car with the given speed and battery drain.
func NewCar(speed, batteryDrain int) Car {
	return Car{
		battery:      100,
		batteryDrain: batteryDrain,
		speed:        speed,
		distance:     0,
	}
}

// NewTrack creates a new track with the given distance.
func NewTrack(distance int) Track {
	return Track{distance: distance}
}

// Drive simulates driving the car, updating its battery and distance if there is enough battery.
func Drive(car Car) Car {
	if car.battery >= car.batteryDrain {
		car.battery -= car.batteryDrain
		car.distance += car.speed
	}
	return car
}

// CanFinish checks if the car can finish the track with the current battery.
func CanFinish(car Car, track Track) bool {
	// Calculate the maximum distance the car can travel with the remaining battery
	return (car.battery/car.batteryDrain)*car.speed >= track.distance
}
```

### Explanation

    1. NewCar:

        - Initializes a Car struct with a full battery (100%), the given speed, and battery drain rate.
        ```go
        car := NewCar(5, 2)

        // Output: Car{battery: 100, batteryDrain: 2, speed: 5, distance: 0}

        ```

    2. NewTrack:

        - Initializes a Track struct with the given distance.

        ```go
        track := NewTrack(100)
        // Output: Track{distance: 100}

        ```

    3. Drive:
        - Simulates driving by checking if the car has enough battery. If so, it reduces the battery by the batteryDrain and increases the distance traveled by the car's speed.

        ```go
        car := Drive(car)
        // Output: Car{battery: 98, batteryDrain: 2, speed: 5, distance: 5}

        ```

    4. CanFinish:
        - Determines if the car can finish the track by calculating the maximum possible distance it can travel with the remaining battery. This is done by dividing the battery by batteryDrain to get the number of possible drives, then multiplying by the car's speed.

        ```go
        canFinish := CanFinish(car, track)
        // Output: true/false (depending on whether the car can finish the track)

        ```

### Time and Space Complexity
    - #### **Time Complexity**:

        - All operations are O(1) because we're performing simple arithmetic checks and updates that don't depend on the size of any inputs.

    - #### **Space Complexity**:

        - All functions operate with constant space, so the space complexity is O(1).


## Conclusion
By using simple arithmetic operations and struct-based modeling, we efficiently solve the NeedForSpeed problem. The solution involves checking the battery and adjusting the car's state accordingly as it drives around the track. Using Go's struct types makes it easy to encapsulate the car's state and simulate the race effectively.
