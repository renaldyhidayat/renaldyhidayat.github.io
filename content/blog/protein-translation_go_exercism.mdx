## Problem Statement

The Protein Translation problem involves converting a sequence of RNA (ribonucleic acid) into a sequence of proteins. RNA is read in codons, which are groups of three nucleotides. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid or signals the end of the protein synthesis. The task is to interpret the RNA sequence and translate it into the respective proteins until a stop codon is reached.

## Approach

### Algorithm

1. **RNA Reading**:
   - Iterate through the RNA string in chunks of three (codons).
   - For each codon, check if it is a valid codon and determine the corresponding amino acid.

2. **Stop Codon Handling**:
   - If a stop codon (UAA, UAG, UGA) is encountered, the translation should end, and the proteins translated so far should be returned.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If an invalid codon is found or the RNA length is not a multiple of three, return an error.

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go implementation for translating RNA to proteins:

```go
// Package protein provides functionality for translating RNA sequences into proteins.
package protein

import "errors"

var ErrStop = errors.New("STOP")
var ErrInvalidBase = errors.New("Invalid Base")

// FromRNA translates an RNA sequence into a slice of proteins.
func FromRNA(rna string) ([]string, error) {
	var result = []string{}

	for i := 0; i < len(rna); i += 3 {
		if i+3 > len(rna) {
			return result, ErrInvalidBase
		}

		s, e := FromCodon(rna[i : i+3])

		if e == ErrStop {
			return result, nil
		} else if e == nil {
			result = append(result, s)
		}
	}

	return result, nil
}

// FromCodon translates a single RNA codon into a corresponding protein.
func FromCodon(codon string) (string, error) {
	switch codon {
	case "AUG":
		return "Methionine", nil
	case "UUU", "UUC":
		return "Phenylalanine", nil
	case "UUA", "UUG":
		return "Leucine", nil
	case "UCG", "UCU", "UCA", "UCC":
		return "Serine", nil
	case "UAU", "UAC":
		return "Tyrosine", nil
	case "UGG":
		return "Tryptophan", nil
	case "UGU", "UGC":
		return "Cysteine", nil
	case "UAA", "UAG", "UGA":
		return "", ErrStop
	default:
		return "", ErrInvalidBase
	}
}
```

## Explanation
    - **FromRNA Function**: This function takes an RNA sequence as input, iterating through it three nucleotides at a time. For each triplet (codon), it calls the FromCodon function to translate it into the corresponding protein. If it encounters a stop codon, it stops further translation.

    - **FromCodon Function**: This function maps a given RNA codon to its respective amino acid. It uses a switch statement for efficient matching. If a stop codon is found, it returns an empty string with an ErrStop error.

## Time and Space Complexity
    - #### Time Complexity: O(n)

        - The time complexity is linear, as the function processes each nucleotide in the RNA sequence exactly once, where n is the length of the RNA string.
    - #### **Space Complexity**: O(m)

        - The space complexity depends on the number of proteins produced, where m is the number of valid proteins returned. This grows based on the number of valid codons processed before reaching a stop codon.

## Conclusion
The Protein Translation problem is effectively addressed with a structured approach in Go. By iterating through the RNA sequence and translating codons into proteins, the solution captures the essence of biological processes efficiently. With appropriate error handling for invalid codons and stop signals, this implementation provides a robust solution to the problem.
