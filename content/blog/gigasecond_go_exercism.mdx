## Problem Statement

The "Gigasecond" problem involves adding exactly one gigasecond (1,000,000,000 seconds) to a given time. A gigasecond is equivalent to 31.7 years, and the goal is to find the exact date and time that is 1 gigasecond from a given input date.

For example:
- If the input date is `January 1, 2000, 00:00:00`, the output should be `September 9, 2031, 01:46:40`.

## Approach

Go’s `time` package provides a convenient way to work with time durations. We can use the `Add` method, which allows adding a specified number of seconds to a `time.Time` object. The number of seconds to add is 1,000,000,000, which is the definition of a gigasecond.

### Algorithm

1. **Input**: A `time.Time` object representing the start time.
2. **Operation**: Add exactly 1 gigasecond (1,000,000,000 seconds) to the input time using the `Add` method from the `time` package.
3. **Output**: Return the new time after adding 1 gigasecond.

### Implementation in Go

Here’s the implementation of the `AddGigasecond` function in Go:

```go
package gigasecond

import "time"

// AddGigasecond adds a Gigasecond (1 billion seconds) to the given time.
func AddGigasecond(t time.Time) time.Time {
	return t.Add(time.Second * 1000000000)
}

```

###Explanation

	- **time.Time Object**: The time.Time type in Go represents a point in time. The Add method allows adding a duration to this time.
	- **time.Second Constant**: The constant time.Second represents a single second in Go’s time package. By multiplying this constant by 1,000,000,000, we calculate the exact duration of a gigasecond.
	- **Return Value**: The function returns the new time, which is the result of adding a gigasecond to the input time.

### Time and Space Complexity
	- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(1) because the Add operation is a constant-time arithmetic operation.
	- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) as well, since only a constant amount of additional space is required to store the result.

## Conclusion
The "Gigasecond" problem is a straightforward application of Go’s time package. By leveraging the built-in time manipulation functions, we can efficiently solve the problem with constant time and space complexity. This is an excellent example of how Go’s standard library simplifies common tasks like date and time arithmetic.
