## Problem Statement

The **Connect** problem involves determining the winner of a game played on a hexagonal board where two players take turns placing stones on the board. Player X wins if they can connect the left and right sides of the board, while player O wins if they connect the top and bottom sides.

Given the current board configuration, our goal is to check if either player has achieved a connected path across the board.

## Approach

The problem is similar to pathfinding in graphs. Each player's goal is to create a continuous path across the board. We can think of the stones as graph nodes and the possible neighboring positions (adjacent hexagonal cells) as edges. A recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach can be used to explore possible paths for both players.

### Algorithm

1. **Board Representation**:
   - The board is represented as a 2D array of strings where each string is either `"X"`, `"O"`, or `"."` (empty position).

2. **Pathfinding (DFS)**:
   - For each player, we begin exploring the board from the starting side (top row for O, left column for X).
   - Use DFS to find a valid route across the board. For player O, we check if a path exists from the top to the bottom of the board, and for player X, from the left to the right.
   - We keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting nodes.

3. **Board Transformation**:
   - Since the board is hexagonal, it requires special handling of neighbor cells, including diagonals.
   - For player X, we can "rotate" the board, treating it as if X is also trying to connect top to bottom, simplifying the algorithm.

4. **Validation**:
   - The algorithm should also handle edge cases, such as empty boards or invalid inputs.

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go solution for the **Connect** problem:

```go
package connect

import (
	"errors"
	"strings"
)

func ResultOf(lines []string) (string, error) {
	if len(lines) == 0 {
		return "", errors.New("board has no positions")
	}
	rectangleBoard := [][]string{}
	for _, line := range lines {
		rectangleBoard = append(rectangleBoard, strings.Split(line, ""))
	}
	for index, stone := range rectangleBoard[0] {
		if stone == "O" && RouteExists([][2]int{{0, index}}, rectangleBoard, "O") {
			return "O", nil
		}
	}
	rectangleBoard = FlipBoard(rectangleBoard)
	for index, stone := range rectangleBoard[0] {
		if stone == "X" && RouteExists([][2]int{{0, index}}, rectangleBoard, "X") {
			return "X", nil
		}
	}
	return "", nil
}

func RouteExists(route [][2]int, board [][]string, stoneType string) bool {
	if route[len(route)-1][0] == len(board)-1 {
		return true
	}
	for _, stone := range GetValidNextStones(route, board, stoneType) {
		var routeCopy [][2]int
		routeCopy = append(routeCopy, append(route, stone)...)
		if RouteExists(routeCopy, board, stoneType) {
			return true
		}
	}
	return false
}

func GetValidNextStones(route [][2]int, board [][]string, stoneType string) [][2]int {
	potentialPositions := GetPotentialPositions(route[len(route)-1], board)
	actualPositions := [][2]int{}
	for _, position := range potentialPositions {
		if !ContainedInRoute(route, position) && board[position[0]][position[1]] == stoneType {
			actualPositions = append(actualPositions, position)
		}
	}
	return actualPositions
}

func GetPotentialPositions(lastStone [2]int, board [][]string) [][2]int {
	potentialPositions := [][2]int{}
	if lastStone[1] > 0 {
		potentialPositions = append(potentialPositions, [2]int{lastStone[0], lastStone[1] - 1})
	}
	if lastStone[1] < len(board[lastStone[0]])-1 {
		potentialPositions = append(potentialPositions, [2]int{lastStone[0], lastStone[1] + 1})
	}
	if lastStone[0] > 0 {
		potentialPositions = append(potentialPositions, [2]int{lastStone[0] - 1, lastStone[1]})
	}
	if lastStone[0] < len(board)-1 {
		potentialPositions = append(potentialPositions, [2]int{lastStone[0] + 1, lastStone[1]})
	}
	if lastStone[1] > 0 && lastStone[0] < len(board)-1 {
		potentialPositions = append(potentialPositions, [2]int{lastStone[0] + 1, lastStone[1] - 1})
	}
	if lastStone[0] > 0 && lastStone[1] < len(board[lastStone[0]])-1 {
		potentialPositions = append(potentialPositions, [2]int{lastStone[0] - 1, lastStone[1] + 1})
	}
	return potentialPositions
}

func ContainedInRoute(route [][2]int, position [2]int) bool {
	for _, routePosition := range route {
		if position == routePosition {
			return true
		}
	}
	return false
}

func FlipBoard(board [][]string) [][]string {
	newBoard := [][]string{}
	for columnIndex := range board[0] {
		newRow := []string{}
		for rowIndex := range board {
			newRow = append(newRow, board[rowIndex][columnIndex])
		}
		newBoard = append(newBoard, newRow)
	}
	return newBoard
}
```


### Explanation
    - **Board Representation**:

        - The board is first split into a 2D slice of strings where each element represents a position ("X", "O", or ".").

    - **Route Exists**:

        - The RouteExists function checks whether a continuous path exists for a given stone type using recursive DFS.
        - It uses helper functions like GetValidNextStones to get the valid neighboring stones that match the current player's stone type.

    - **Flipping the Board**:

        - Since player X needs to connect the left and right sides, the board is "flipped" to treat it as if X is trying to connect top to bottom, making the pathfinding algorithm reusable for both players.
    
    - **Edge Case Handling**:

        - The algorithm gracefully handles cases like an empty board by returning an error message.


### Time and Space Complexity


    - **Time Complexity**:

        - Each cell on the board is visited once, and for each stone, we check its neighboring cells. Thus, the time complexity is approximately O(n), where n is the total number of cells on the board.
    
    - *Space Complexity**:

        - The space complexity is O(n) due to the recursive DFS and the stack required to store the route.

## Conclusion
The Connect problem is a classic example of a pathfinding problem on a hexagonal grid. By using a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach and efficiently managing the board's structure, the problem can be solved in a time-efficient manner. The Go implementation ensures clean and modular handling of board traversal and validation.
