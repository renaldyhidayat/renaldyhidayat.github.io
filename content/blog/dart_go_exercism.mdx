## Problem Statement

In this problem, we are tasked with determining the score of a dart throw based on its Cartesian coordinates `(x, y)`. The dartboard is represented by three concentric rings:
- The bullseye (center) has a radius of 1 and awards 10 points.
- The middle ring has a radius of 5 and awards 5 points.
- The outer ring has a radius of 10 and awards 1 point.
- Any dart that lands outside the outer ring scores 0 points.

The objective is to write a function `Score(x, y float64) int` that calculates the score based on the dart's coordinates.

## Approach

The approach involves calculating the distance from the dart to the center of the dartboard, which is located at `(0, 0)`. This is done using the formula for the Euclidean distance:

```plaintext
distance = x^2 + y^2
```
We then compare the squared distance with the radii of the different dartboard rings to determine the appropriate score.

### Algorithm

1. Compute the squared distance from the dart to the origin using the formula ``$$x^2 + y^2$$``.
2. Compare this distance against the predefined ring radii:
   - If the distance is less than or equal to 1, the dart is within the bullseye and scores 10 points.
   - If the distance is greater than 1 but less than or equal to 25, the dart is within the middle ring and scores 5 points.
   - If the distance is greater than 25 but less than or equal to 100, the dart is within the outer ring and scores 1 point.
   - If the distance is greater than 100, the dart is outside the dartboard and scores 0 points.

### Implementation in Go

```go
// Package darts provides a function to score a dart throw based on its cartesian coordinates with a 3-ring
// dartboard with a radius of 10 and scores of 10, 5 and 1 for the bullseye, middle and outer rings,
// respectively.
package darts

// Score provides the integer score of a dart throw on a radius-10 dartboard with 3 rings of radius 1, 5
// and 10 and scores of 10, 5, and 1.
func Score(x, y float64) int {
    // Calculate squared distance from the origin
    distance := x*x + y*y

    // Determine the score based on the dart's distance from the origin
    switch {
    case distance <= 1:
        return 10
    case distance <= 25:
        return 5
    case distance <= 100:
        return 1
    default:
        return 0
    }
}
```


### Explanation
    - Distance Calculation: The formula x*x + y*y calculates the square of the distance from the point (x, y) to the origin. This avoids using the square root function, which can be computationally more expensive.

    - Switch Statement: The switch statement is used to compare the squared distance with the thresholds for each scoring ring:

            - For a dart inside the bullseye (radius 1), it returns a score of 10.
            - For a dart inside the middle ring (radius 5), it returns 5.
            - For a dart inside the outer ring (radius 10), it returns 1.
            - If the dart is outside the dartboard, it returns 0.

### Time and Space Complexity
    #### Time Complexity:

        - Calculating the squared distance involves constant time operations, so the time complexity is O(1).
        - The comparison operations inside the switch statement also take constant time, making the overall time complexity O(1).
#### Space Complexity:

        - The space complexity is O(1) since no additional data structures are used and only a few variables are needed.

## Conclusion
The provided solution efficiently solves the Darts problem by leveraging basic geometry and comparison operations. The use of squared distances avoids the need for floating-point square root calculations, improving performance. This solution is optimal with constant time and space complexity.
