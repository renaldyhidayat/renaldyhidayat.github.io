## Description

**Subnet Calculation Ratatui** is a terminal-based application for calculating subnet information such as network address, broadcast address, subnet count, and host count. It is built using [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui), a Rust library for creating rich terminal user interfaces.

## Features
- Input an IP address and subnet mask interactively.
- Calculate network address and broadcast address.
- Determine the number of available subnets and hosts per subnet.
- Display results in a structured terminal UI.

## Technologies Used
- **Rust**: Main programming language.
- **Ratatui**: Library for creating terminal-based UI.
- **Crossterm**: Library for handling keyboard input and terminal display.
