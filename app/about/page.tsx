        <p className="text-gray-900 dark:text-slate-200 text-lg leading-7">
          I&apos;m a Computer Science candidate at Nusa Mandiri University, and
          I&apos;m deeply passionate about programming. This passion has driven
          me to explore various facets of technology and has inspired me to
          embark on exciting projects. One of the things I love most about
          programming is the endless opportunity for learning. In this
          ever-evolving field, there&apos;s always something new to discover,
          whether it&apos;s a cutting-edge programming language, a
          groundbreaking framework, or an innovative application of technology.
          I relish the challenge of staying up-to-date with the latest
          developments and incorporating them into my work. Turning my hobbies
          into projects has been a particularly fulfilling aspect of my journey.
          It allows me to blend creativity with technical expertise. Whether
          it&apos;s crafting a web application, developing a software solution,
          I find immense satisfaction in bringing ideas to life through code.
          Above all, I&apos;m dedicated to continuous improvement. I believe
          that the key to success in the tech world is a commitment to lifelong
          learning. Every day presents an opportunity to enhance my knowledge,
          refine my skills, and tackle new challenges head-on. This dedication
          drives me to push the boundaries
